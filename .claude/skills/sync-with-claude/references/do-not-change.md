# Paths to Preserve (Do Not Update or Delete)

These paths in the TARGET repository must NEVER be updated or deleted during sync.
They are specific to the repository and should be preserved as-is.

## Protected Paths

```
claude-code-config/scripts/.claude/skills/fix-on-my-computer
claude-code-config/commands/prompts/setup-tmux.md
```

These paths exist only in the repository (not in ~/.claude) and must be preserved.
