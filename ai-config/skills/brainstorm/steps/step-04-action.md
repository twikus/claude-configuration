# Phase 4: Action Crystallization

**Role: STRATEGIC ADVISOR** - Transform insight into clear, actionable recommendations

---

<available_state>
From previous steps:

- `{topic}` - The research topic
- `{economy_mode}` - If true, used direct tool calls instead of subagents
- `{fast_mode}` - If true, skipped Phase 2 and used 3 perspectives in Phase 3
- `{save_file}` - If true, save session to file
- `{session_path}` - Path to session file (if saving)
- `{phase_1_discoveries}` - Broad findings from Phase 1
- `{phase_2_challenges}` - Challenges from Phase 2 (empty if fast_mode)
- `{phase_3_synthesis}` - Multi-perspective analysis from Phase 3
</available_state>

<mandatory_rules>
## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- 🎯 FORM clear, defensible recommendations - no wishy-washy conclusions
- 📊 ASSIGN confidence levels HONESTLY - admit uncertainty
- ⚔️ PRESENT the strongest contrarian view - steelman the opposition
- 📋 CREATE actionable next steps - specific, not vague
- 🔗 CITE sources for key claims
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN: Vague conclusions like "it depends" without specifics
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN: Hiding uncertainty behind confident language
</mandatory_rules>

<ultra_think>
**1. ULTRA THINK: Deep Synthesis**

Before producing output, deeply consider:

**What do the phases tell us?**
- Phase 1 (Exploration): The landscape is...
- Phase 2 (Challenge): After stress-testing, the strongest findings are... *(skip if fast_mode)*
- Phase 3 (Multi-lens): Across perspectives, the clearest signals are...

**What's my honest recommendation?**
- If I had to advise someone today, I would say...
- The confidence I have in this is... because...

**What would change my mind?**
- If [evidence/event], I would reconsider
- The weakest part of my reasoning is...

**What's the strongest argument against my recommendation?**
- The best counter-argument is...
- Why someone might reasonably disagree...
</ultra_think>

**2. Generate Final Output**

Produce the final brainstorm output in this format:

```markdown
## 🧠 Brainstorm: {topic}

### Research Summary

**Process completed:**
- **Phase 1 (Exploration):** [# of sources], [breadth of coverage]
- **Phase 2 (Challenge):** [# of findings challenged], [# revised] *(skipped if fast_mode)*
- **Phase 3 (Synthesis):** [3 or 5] perspectives analyzed, [key patterns found]
- **Mode:** [Standard / Economy / Fast / Economy+Fast]

**Key areas investigated:**
- [Area 1]
- [Area 2]
- [Area 3]

### Key Insights

1. **[Insight 1]** - Confidence: **High/Medium/Low**
   - [Supporting evidence and reasoning]

2. **[Insight 2]** - Confidence: **High/Medium/Low**
   - [Supporting evidence and reasoning]

3. **[Insight 3]** - Confidence: **High/Medium/Low**

### Recommendation

**Primary recommendation:**
[Clear, specific recommendation]

**Rationale:**
[Why this recommendation based on all research]

**Key tradeoffs accepted:**
- [Tradeoff 1]: We're choosing [X] over [Y] because...
- [Tradeoff 2]: We're accepting [risk] for [benefit]

**Overall Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]**
- Would change to higher if: [evidence needed]
- Would change to lower if: [counter-evidence]

<confidence_calibration>
## Confidence Level Guidelines

**High Confidence:**
- Multiple independent sources agree
- Survived skeptical challenge
- Multiple perspectives converge
- Clear evidence, minimal assumptions

**Medium Confidence:**
- Good evidence but some gaps
- Some perspectives diverge
- Reasonable assumptions required
- More investigation would help

**Low Confidence:**
- Limited evidence
- Significant uncertainty
- Conflicting perspectives
- Important assumptions untested
</confidence_calibration>

---

<success_metrics>

- Clear, specific recommendations (not "it depends")
- Honest confidence levels with calibration
- Strongest contrarian view presented fairly
- Actionable next steps (specific, not vague)
- Open questions acknowledge what we don't know
- Sources cited for key claims
- Complete output format followed
</success_metrics>

<failure_modes>

- Vague recommendations that don't commit
- Overconfident conclusions hiding uncertainty
- Weak strawman of contrarian view
- "Next steps" that are too generic to act on
- Forgetting to cite sources
- Rushing the synthesis without ULTRA THINK
</failure_modes>
