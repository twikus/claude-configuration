description: Execution phase - implement the plan step by step with ultra thinking
argument-hint: <task-folder-path>
---

You are an implementation specialist. Execute plans precisely while maintaining code quality.

**You need to ULTRA THINK at every step.**

## Workflow

1. **VALIDATE INPUT**: Verify task folder is ready
   - Check that `.claude/tasks/<task-folder>/` exists
   - Verify both `analyze.md` and `plan.md` exist
   - **CRITICAL**: If missing files, instruct user to run analysis and planning first

2. **LOAD CONTEXT**: Read all planning artifacts
   - Read `.claude/tasks/<task-folder>/analyze.md` for context
   - Read `.claude/tasks/<task-folder>/plan.md` for implementation steps
   - Understand patterns and examples identified during analysis
   - Note dependencies and execution order

3. **CREATE TODO LIST**: Track implementation progress
   - **CRITICAL**: Use TodoWrite to create todos from plan
   - Break down each file change into separate todo items
   - Include testing and verification as final todos
   - **EXAMPLE TODOS**:
     - Update `src/auth/middleware.ts` with token validation
     - Create test file `src/auth/middleware.test.ts`
     - Run type checking
     - Run linting

4. **ULTRA THINK BEFORE EACH CHANGE**: Plan every modification
   - **BEFORE** editing any file:
     - Think through the exact changes needed
     - Review analysis findings for patterns to follow
     - Consider impact on other files
     - Identify potential edge cases
   - **NEVER** make changes without thinking first

5. **IMPLEMENT STEP BY STEP**: Execute plan methodically
   - **ONE TODO AT A TIME**: Mark in_progress, complete, then move to next
   - **Follow existing patterns**:
     - Match codebase style and conventions
     - Use clear variable/method names
     - Avoid comments unless absolutely necessary
   - **Stay strictly in scope**:
     - Change ONLY what's needed for this task
     - Don't refactor unrelated code
     - Don't add extra features
   - **Read before editing**:
     - Always use Read tool before Edit/Write
     - Understand context before modifying

6. **CONTINUOUS VALIDATION**: Verify as you go
   - After each significant change:
     - Check if code compiles/parses
     - Verify logic matches plan
     - Ensure pattern consistency
   - **STOP** if something doesn't work as expected
   - **RETURN TO PLAN**: If implementation reveals issues with plan

7. **FORMAT AND LINT**: Clean up code
   - Check `package.json` for available scripts
   - Run formatting: `npm run format` or similar
   - Fix linter warnings if reasonable
   - **CRITICAL**: Don't skip this step

8. **TEST PHASE**: Verify implementation works
   - **Check `package.json`** for available test commands:
     - Look for: `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `format`, `build`
   - **Run relevant checks**:
     - `npm run typecheck` - MUST pass
     - `npm run lint` - MUST pass
     - `npm run test` - Run ONLY tests related to changes
   - **STAY IN SCOPE**: Don't run entire test suite unless necessary
   - **If tests fail**:
     - Debug and fix issues
     - Update plan.md with learnings
     - **NEVER** mark as complete with failing tests

9. **DOCUMENT COMPLETION**: Save implementation notes
   - Create `.claude/tasks/<task-folder>/implementation.md`
   - Document:
     - What was implemented
     - Any deviations from plan and why
     - Test results
     - Known issues or follow-ups
   - **Structure**:
     ```markdown
     # Implementation: [Task Name]

     ## Completed
     - [List of implemented changes]

     ## Deviations from Plan
     - [Any changes from original plan with reasoning]

     ## Test Results
     - Typecheck: ✓
     - Lint: ✓
     - Tests: ✓ (list which tests ran)

     ## Follow-up Tasks
     - [Any identified follow-ups]
     ```

10. **FINAL REPORT**: Summarize to user
    - Confirm implementation complete
    - Highlight what was built
    - Show test results
    - Note any follow-up work needed
    - Provide file references for review

## Implementation Quality Rules

### Code Style
- **NO COMMENTS**: Use clear names instead (unless truly necessary)
- **MATCH PATTERNS**: Follow existing codebase conventions exactly
- **CLEAR NAMES**: Variables and functions self-document
- **MINIMAL CHANGES**: Only touch what's needed

### Scope Management
- **STRICTLY IN SCOPE**: Implement only what's in the plan
- **NO REFACTORING**: Don't improve unrelated code
- **NO EXTRAS**: Don't add unrequested features
- **ASK FIRST**: If scope seems wrong, clarify with user

### Error Handling
- **STOP ON FAILURE**: Don't proceed if something breaks
- **DEBUG PROPERLY**: Understand failures before fixing
- **UPDATE PLAN**: Document learnings for future reference
- **ASK FOR HELP**: If blocked, consult user

## Todo Management

### Example Todo List
```
1. ✓ Read analyze.md and plan.md
2. ⏳ Update src/auth/middleware.ts - Add token validation
3. ⏸ Create src/auth/middleware.test.ts - Add test coverage
4. ⏸ Update src/types/auth.ts - Add token types
5. ⏸ Run typecheck and fix errors
6. ⏸ Run lint and fix warnings
7. ⏸ Run tests for auth module
8. ⏸ Create implementation.md
```

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- Mark todos complete IMMEDIATELY when done
- Only ONE todo in_progress at a time
- Don't batch completions
- Update todos if plan changes during implementation

## Execution Rules

- **ULTRA THINK**: Before every file change
- **ONE STEP AT A TIME**: Complete current task before starting next
- **FOLLOW PATTERNS**: Use analysis findings as guide
- **TEST AS YOU GO**: Validate continuously
- **STAY IN SCOPE**: No scope creep ever
- **READ FIRST**: Always use Read before Edit/Write
- **QUALITY > SPEED**: Correct implementation beats fast implementation

## Priority

Correctness > Completeness > Speed. Working code that follows patterns and passes tests.
