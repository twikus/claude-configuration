description: Challenge and validate a business idea through competitive research and brutally honest market analysis
argument-hint: [idea description]
---

<objective>
Challenge and validate $ARGUMENTS through competitive research, market analysis, and strategic brainstorming.

Provide brutally honest, evidence-based feedback on whether the idea has genuine market potential or should be abandoned/pivoted. Beyond validation, generate concrete MOAT and USP ideas that could make the SaaS defensible and successful in a crowded market.

Save founders from wasting time on bad ideas - or help them find the angle that makes their idea actually work.
</objective>

<process>

## Phase 1: Gather the Idea

1. **If idea not provided in $ARGUMENTS**, ask the user:
   > "Tell me about your idea:
   > - What problem does it solve?
   > - Who is it for?
   > - What's your proposed solution?
   > - What makes it different?"

2. **Do NOT proceed** until you understand:
   - The specific problem being solved
   - The target user/customer
   - The proposed solution
   - Any claimed differentiation

## Phase 2: Research Competitors

3. **Use web search** to find existing solutions:
   - Search: "[problem] tool", "[solution] software", "[target user] platform"
   - Check: Product Hunt, Y Combinator portfolio, Crunchbase
   - Search: Reddit discussions, Alternative.to

4. **For each competitor**, document:
   - Name and URL
   - What they do (brief description)
   - Pricing model (free/paid/freemium)
   - Revenue signals: funding, team size, visible traction
   - Market positioning
   - Weaknesses and gaps

5. **Find 5-10 competitors minimum** - both direct and indirect:
   - **Direct**: Same problem, same solution approach
   - **Indirect**: Same problem, different solution approach

## Phase 3: Analyze the Market

6. **Assess market saturation**:
   - 10+ competitors = Crowded (high risk, need strong differentiation)
   - 3-9 competitors = Moderate (validated demand, need positioning)
   - 1-2 competitors = Sparse (early market or weak demand)
   - 0 competitors = Usually no market (rarely means opportunity)

7. **Evaluate revenue signals**:
   - **Strong**: Paid tiers, funding raised, growing teams
   - **Weak**: Free only, abandoned projects, no monetization

8. **Check opportunity**:
   - Is there proof people PAY for this?
   - Is there room for another player?
   - What would truly differentiate this idea?

## Phase 4: Brainstorm MOAT Ideas

9. **Generate 3-5 MOAT (defensibility) ideas** - things that make the SaaS hard to recreate:
   - **Data Network Effects**: How can user data make the product better over time?
   - **Community/Ecosystem**: Can you build a community that competitors can't replicate?
   - **Integrations/Partnerships**: What exclusive integrations create switching costs?
   - **Proprietary Data/Algorithm**: What unique data or ML model could you build?
   - **Brand/Trust**: What niche authority could you establish?
   - **Speed/Execution**: What first-mover advantage is achievable?

10. **Evaluate each MOAT idea**:
    - How long to build?
    - How defensible once built?
    - Does it compound over time?

## Phase 5: Brainstorm USP/Killer Feature Ideas

11. **Generate 3-5 Unique Selling Proposition ideas** - the "hook" that makes people switch:
    - What feature would make users say "I NEED this"?
    - What pain point are competitors ignoring?
    - What 10x improvement is possible in one specific area?
    - What contrarian angle could work? (simpler vs complex, vertical vs horizontal, etc.)

12. **For each USP idea**, consider:
    - Is it defensible or easily copied?
    - Does it matter to paying customers?
    - Can you deliver it as a solo/small team?

## Phase 6: Deliver Honest Feedback

13. **Generate validation report** in this format:

```markdown
# Validation: [Idea Name]

## Quick Summary
[1 sentence - what their idea is]

## What I Found

**Competitors**:
1. [Name] - [What they do, pricing, traction signals, key weakness]
2. [Name] - [What they do, pricing, traction signals, key weakness]
3. [Continue for 3-5 key competitors]

**Market**: [Crowded/Moderate/Sparse] - [1 sentence why]
**Revenue proof**: [Yes/No] - [Evidence people pay for this]

## Viability Score: [X/10]

[2-3 sentences explaining the score - be direct, no fluff]

## The Hard Truth

**What's actually unique**: [What truly differentiates this, if anything]
**What's NOT unique**: [What they claim is unique but competitors already do]

**Biggest problems**:
- [Problem 1]
- [Problem 2]
- [Problem 3]

## MOAT Brainstorm (Defensibility Ideas)

**What could make this hard to copy?**

1. **[MOAT Type]**: [Specific idea]
   - Build time: [X months]
   - Defensibility: [Low/Medium/High]
   - Compounds: [Yes/No - why]

2. **[MOAT Type]**: [Specific idea]
   - Build time: [X months]
   - Defensibility: [Low/Medium/High]
   - Compounds: [Yes/No - why]

3. **[MOAT Type]**: [Specific idea]
   - Build time: [X months]
   - Defensibility: [Low/Medium/High]
   - Compounds: [Yes/No - why]

**Best MOAT opportunity**: [Which one and why]

---

## USP/Killer Feature Brainstorm

**What could make users switch or choose you?**

1. **[USP Name]**: [Description]
   - Why it matters: [User pain it solves]
   - Competitors doing this: [None/Some - who]
   - Copyable: [Easy/Medium/Hard]

2. **[USP Name]**: [Description]
   - Why it matters: [User pain it solves]
   - Competitors doing this: [None/Some - who]
   - Copyable: [Easy/Medium/Hard]

3. **[USP Name]**: [Description]
   - Why it matters: [User pain it solves]
   - Competitors doing this: [None/Some - who]
   - Copyable: [Easy/Medium/Hard]

**Best USP opportunity**: [Which one and why - this is your hook]

## My Take

**Would I build this?** [Yes/No/Maybe]

**Why**: [Honest opinion in 1-2 sentences - don't hold back]

**If you proceed**:
- **Lead with**: [Best USP from brainstorm]
- **Build toward**: [Best MOAT from brainstorm]
- **Ignore**: [What competitors do that you shouldn't copy]

**If you pivot**: [Specific pivot suggestion based on research]

**Bottom line**: [Final direct recommendation - pursue with [specific angle], pivot to [X], or kill]
```

</process>

<constraints>
**BE BRUTALLY HONEST**:
- Don't sugarcoat bad ideas
- Be rude if necessary - founders need truth
- Call out red flags directly
- Use evidence from research, not opinions

**ALWAYS RESEARCH FIRST**:
- Never give feedback without finding real competitors
- Challenge claims of "no competitors exist"
- Focus on whether people actually PAY for solutions

**MOAT/USP BRAINSTORMING RULES**:
- Be specific, not generic ("AI-powered" is not a MOAT)
- Consider founder's realistic resources (solo founder vs team)
- Focus on compounding advantages, not one-time features
- Prioritize ideas that are hard to copy AND valuable to users

**RED FLAGS TO CALL OUT**:
- "Uber for X" without unique insight
- Solution looking for a problem
- Targeting "everyone" (no clear user)
- Ignoring dominant market leaders
- Claims no competitors exist (almost always false)
- MOATs that don't compound over time
- USPs that are easily copied in a weekend
</constraints>
