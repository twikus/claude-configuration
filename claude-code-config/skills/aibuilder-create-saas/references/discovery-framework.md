# Smart Discovery Framework

A practical framework for finding SaaS ideas worth building.
Inspired by: **The Mom Test** + **Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)** + **Indie Hacker Wisdom**.

---

## The Goal

Find an idea that:
1. **Solves YOUR problem** (or one you deeply understand)
2. **Can be built in 2 weeks** (MVP, not perfect)
3. **Has a clear path to first users** (you know where they are)

**Perfect > shipped = Nothing.**
**Shipped > perfect = Learning.**

## The Mom Test: 3 Core Rules

### Rule 1: Talk about THEIR life, not YOUR idea

❌ BAD: "Would you use an app that..."
✅ GOOD: "Tell me about the last time you struggled with..."

❌ BAD: "Do you think this is a good idea?"
✅ GOOD: "How are you currently solving this problem?"

### Rule 2: Ask about PAST behavior, not FUTURE intentions

❌ BAD: "Would you pay $20/month for this?"
✅ GOOD: "How much have you already spent trying to solve this?"

❌ BAD: "Would you use this feature?"
✅ GOOD: "What did you do the last time this happened?"

### Rule 3: Talk LESS, listen MORE

- You should talk 20% of the time
- They should talk 80% of the time
- Silence is golden — let them fill gaps

## Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Framework

People don't buy products. They **hire** them to do a job.

### The JTBD Interview Formula

**When** [situation/trigger]
**I want to** [motivation/goal]
**So I can** [expected outcome]

### Example JTBD Statements

| Situation | Motivation | Outcome |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| When I'm working on a project deadline | I want to quickly share files with my team | So I can get feedback without email chains |
| When I finish a workout | I want to log my progress easily | So I can see my improvement over time |
| When I'm planning content for the week | I want to see all my ideas in one place | So I can batch create efficiently |

### The Switch Interview

Ask about the **last time they switched** from one solution to another:

1. "What was the first thought that made you want to change?"
2. "What finally pushed you to actually make the switch?"
3. "What almost held you back?"
4. "What's better about the new solution?"
5. "What do you miss about the old one?"

## The 5 Discovery Categories

### Category 1: Manual Tasks to Automate

**Purpose:** Find repetitive pain that software can eliminate

**Questions:**
```
→ "Walk me through your typical [day/week]. What takes the most time?"
→ "What task do you dread doing every [week/month]?"
→ "If you could hire an assistant for one thing, what would it be?"
→ "What do you copy-paste between tools regularly?"
→ "What's a task you always put off until the last minute?"
```

**Follow-up probes:**
- "How long does that actually take you?"
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What happens if you don't do it?"

### Category 2: Work/School Pain Points

**Purpose:** Identify B2B opportunities with real budget

**Questions:**
```
→ "What process at work makes everyone complain?"
→ "What information is hardest to find when you need it?"
→ "What do new hires struggle with most?"
→ "What manual work could be automated but isn't?"
→ "What tools does your company pay for that no one actually uses?"
```

**Follow-up probes:**
- "Who is responsible for fixing this?"
- "Has anyone tried to solve this before? What happened?"
- "What would it be worth if this was solved?"

### Category 3: Tools You Pay For (Simplification Opportunities)

**Purpose:** Find overpriced/overcomplicated solutions to replace

**Questions:**
```
→ "What tool do you pay for but only use 20% of?"
→ "What subscription would you cancel if you found something simpler?"
→ "What tool frustrates you every time you use it?"
→ "What do you wish [tool name] did that it doesn't?"
→ "What made you start paying for this? What problem was urgent?"
```

**Follow-up probes:**
- "How much do you pay per month?"
- "What would make you switch tomorrow?"
- "What features do you never use?"

### Category 4: Community Problems

**Purpose:** Find niche markets with passionate users

**Questions:**
```
→ "What's the #1 complaint in your [community/club/group]?"
→ "What tool does everyone wish existed for [hobby/interest]?"
→ "What's the biggest coordination problem your group faces?"
→ "How do people currently organize [events/activities/communication]?"
→ "What would make your community more active/engaged?"
```

**Follow-up probes:**
- "How many people have this problem?"
- "How do they solve it today?"
- "Would the community pay for a solution?"

### Category 5: Spreadsheet/Notion Systems

**Purpose:** Find validated product ideas hiding in manual systems

**Questions:**
```
→ "What's your most complex spreadsheet?"
→ "What Notion database took you forever to set up?"
→ "What system breaks if you don't maintain it manually?"
→ "What do you track that should be automatic?"
→ "What reports do you create manually every [week/month]?"
```

**Follow-up probes:**
- "How long did it take to set this up?"
- "What breaks most often?"
- "Would you pay for this as a proper tool?"

## Bonus: Previous Project Insights

**For people who have built before:**

```
→ "What API or service was missing when you built [project]?"
→ "What part of development was unexpectedly hard?"
→ "What would you have paid for to save time?"
→ "What problem did your users complain about most?"
→ "If you rebuilt it today, what would you do differently?"
```

## The Magic Questions

### To understand problem severity:

1. **"Why do you bother?"**
   → Gets to real motivation behind surface problem

2. **"What are the implications of that?"**
   → Distinguishes annoying problems from expensive ones

3. **"Talk me through the last time that happened."**
   → Gets real behavior, not hypothetical

4. **"What else have you tried?"**
   → Shows if they're actively seeking solutions (good sign!)

5. **"How are you dealing with it now?"**
   → Establishes price anchor based on current costs

### To understand buying behavior:

6. **"Where does the money come from?"**
   → Critical for B2B — identifies budget owner

7. **"Who else should I talk to?"**
   → Expands your network of prospects

8. **"Is there anything else I should have asked?"**
   → Often reveals hidden gems

## Red Flags vs Green Flags

### 🚩 Red Flags (Problem isn't real)

- "Yeah, that would be nice..." (lukewarm)
- Can't remember last time it happened
- No current workaround or solution
- "I'd definitely use it!" (without specifics)
- Never spent money/time on alternatives
- The problem is "everyone"

### 🟢 Green Flags (Problem is real)

- Tells specific stories with emotion
- Currently using a hacky workaround
- Has already tried/paid for alternatives
- Can quantify the cost (time or money)
- Asks "When can I get this?"
- Offers to pay or pre-order

---

## The Commitment Ladder

Real interest = Real commitment. Escalate to test:

| Level | Commitment | What it Means |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Time commitment | They'll take a meeting |
| 2 | Reputation risk | They'll introduce you to others |
| 3 | Financial commitment | They'll pre-pay or letter of intent |
| 4 | Active investment | They'll help build/test it |

**If they won't climb the ladder, the problem isn't real enough.**

## Interview Structure

### Opening (2 min)
- "I'm trying to understand how people handle [problem area]"
- "There are no wrong answers — I'm just learning"

### Context (5 min)
- "Tell me about your role / situation"
- "Walk me through a typical [day/week]"

### Problem Deep-Dive (15 min)
- Use category questions above
- Follow every answer with "Tell me more about that"
- Ask "Why?" at least 3 times

### Solution Exploration (5 min)
- "What have you tried?"
- "What would the ideal solution look like?"
- "How would you know if it was working?"

### Commitment (3 min)

## Post-Interview Checklist

After each interview, answer:

- [ ] Did I learn something I didn't know?
- [ ] Did they give specific examples from the past?
- [ ] Did they show emotional investment?
- [ ] Would they pay money to solve this?
- [ ] Did they commit to something (time/intro/money)?

**If mostly NO → Problem isn't real enough**
**If mostly YES → You're onto something**

---

## Minimum Viable Discovery

**Before brainstorming ideas, aim for:**

- [ ] At least 1-2 answers per discovery category
- [ ] At least 1 problem YOU personally experience
- [ ] A rough idea of who else might have this problem

**The best validation is scratching your own itch.**

If you're building for yourself, you already have:
- Deep understanding of the problem
- One guaranteed user (you!)
- Motivation to actually finish it

---

## Quick vs Deep Discovery

### Quick (15-30 min)
- Answer discovery questions from your own experience
- Quick Google search for competitors
- Gut check: would you use this daily?

**Good for:** Side projects, learning, low stakes

### Deep (1-2 hours)
- Answer all discovery categories thoughtfully
- Check 3-5 competitor reviews for complaints
- Ask 2-3 friends/colleagues about the problem

**Good for:** Serious projects, monetization plans

## The Best Ideas Come From

1. **Your daily frustrations** — What annoys you regularly?
2. **Tools you pay for but hate** — What would you replace?
3. **Spreadsheets you maintain** — What could be an app?
4. **Community complaints** — What does everyone wish existed?
5. **Jobs you do manually** — What could be automated?

**Start with YOUR life. The best founders solve their own problems.**
