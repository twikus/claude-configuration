description: Create and optimize CLAUDE.md memory files or .claude/rules/ modular rules for Claude Code projects. Comprehensive guidance on file hierarchy, content structure, path-scoped rules, best practices, and anti-patterns. Use when working with CLAUDE.md files, .claude/rules directories, setting up new projects, or improving Claude Code's context awareness.
---

<objective>
Master the creation of effective Claude Code memory systems using either CLAUDE.md files or the modular `.claude/rules/` directory. This skill covers file hierarchy, content structure, path-scoped rules, formatting, emphasis techniques, and common anti-patterns to avoid.

Memory files are automatically loaded at session startup, consuming tokens from your 200k context window. Every instruction competes with Claude Code's ~50 built-in instructions, leaving ~100-150 effective instruction slots for your customizations.

**Two approaches available:**
- **CLAUDE.md** - Single file, simpler, best for small projects
- **.claude/rules/** - Modular files with optional path-scoping, best for large projects
</objective>

<quick_start>
<bootstrap_new_project>
Run `/init` in Claude Code to auto-generate a CLAUDE.md with project structure.

Or create manually at project root:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Tech Stack
- [Primary language/framework]
- [Key libraries]

## Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run build` - Build for production

## Code Conventions
- [2-3 critical conventions]

## Important Context
- [1-2 architectural decisions worth knowing]
```
</bootstrap_new_project>

<quick_add_memory>
Press `#` during a Claude Code session to quickly add new memory items without editing the file directly.
</quick_add_memory>

<edit_memory>
Use `/memory` command to open CLAUDE.md in your system editor.
</edit_memory>
</quick_start>

<file_hierarchy>
Claude Code loads CLAUDE.md files in a specific order. Higher priority files are loaded first and take precedence.

<loading_order>
| Priority | Location | Purpose | Scope |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 (Highest) | `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md` (macOS) | Enterprise policy (managed by IT) | All org users |
| 2 | `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Project memory (git-tracked) | Team via git |
| 2 | `./.claude/rules/*.md` | Modular rules (git-tracked) | Team via git |
| 3 | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User preferences (global) | All your projects |
| 3 | `~/.claude/rules/*.md` | Personal modular rules (global) | All your projects |
| 4 (Lowest) | `./CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal project prefs (auto-gitignored) | Just you |
</loading_order>

<recursive_loading>
Claude recurses UP from current directory to root, loading all CLAUDE.md files found.

Running Claude in `foo/bar/` loads:
1. `foo/bar/CLAUDE.md`
2. `foo/CLAUDE.md`
3. Root-level files

Claude also discovers CLAUDE.md in SUBTREES when reading files in those directories.
</recursive_loading>

<monorepo_strategy>
For monorepos, use layered approach:

```
root/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Universal: tech stack, git workflow
├── apps/
│   ├── web/CLAUDE.md      # Frontend-specific patterns
│   └── api/CLAUDE.md      # Backend-specific patterns
└── packages/
    └── shared/CLAUDE.md   # Shared library conventions
```

Root file defines WHEN to use patterns; subtree files define HOW.
</monorepo_strategy>
</file_hierarchy>

<rules_directory>
The `.claude/rules/` directory provides a **modular alternative** to monolithic CLAUDE.md files. Instead of one large file, you organize instructions into multiple focused markdown files.

<when_to_use_rules>
**Use `.claude/rules/` when:**
- Project has many distinct concerns (testing, security, API, frontend)
- Different rules apply to different file types
- Team members maintain different areas
- You want to update one concern without touching others

**Use CLAUDE.md when:**
- Project is small/simple
- All rules are universal
- You prefer a single source of truth
</when_to_use_rules>

<rules_structure>
```
.claude/rules/
├── code-style.md      # Formatting and conventions
├── testing.md         # Test requirements
├── security.md        # Security checklist
├── frontend/
│   ├── react.md       # React-specific patterns
│   └── styles.md      # CSS conventions
└── backend/
    ├── api.md         # API development rules
    └── database.md    # Database conventions
```

**Key points:**
- All `.md` files are discovered recursively
- No imports or configuration needed
- Same priority as CLAUDE.md
- Supports symlinks for sharing rules across projects
</rules_structure>

<path_scoped_rules>
Rules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
paths: src/api/**/*.ts
---

# API Development Rules

- All API endpoints must include input validation
- Use the standard error response format
```

**Path patterns supported:**

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `**/*.ts` | All TypeScript files in any directory |
| `src/**/*` | All files under `src/` directory |
| `src/components/*.tsx` | React components in specific directory |
| `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` | TypeScript and TSX files (brace expansion) |
| `{src,lib}/**/*.ts` | Files in multiple directories |

**Rules without `paths` frontmatter** load unconditionally for all files.
</path_scoped_rules>

<user_level_rules>
Create personal rules that apply to all your projects:

```
~/.claude/rules/
├── preferences.md    # Your coding preferences
├── workflows.md      # Your preferred workflows
└── git.md            # Your git conventions
```

User-level rules load before project rules, giving project rules higher priority for overrides.
</user_level_rules>

<symlinks_support>
Share common rules across multiple projects using symlinks:

```bash
# Symlink a shared rules directory
ln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .claude/rules/shared

# Symlink individual rule files
ln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .claude/rules/security.md
```

Circular symlinks are detected and handled gracefully.
</symlinks_support>
</rules_directory>

<content_framework>
Structure your CLAUDE.md using the WHAT-WHY-HOW framework:

**WHAT** - Project Context: Tech stack, directory structure, architecture
**WHY** - Purpose: Architectural decisions, why patterns exist
**HOW** - Workflow: Commands, testing, git workflow, verification steps

```markdown
## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM

## Architecture Decisions
- Server Components for data fetching
- All forms use TanStack Form

## Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start dev server
- `pnpm test:ci` - Run tests
- `pnpm build` - Production build

## Git Workflow
- Branch: `feature/name` or `fix/name`
- Run tests before committing
```

See [references/section-templates.md](references/section-templates.md) for complete templates.
</content_framework>

<emphasis_techniques>
Claude follows emphasized instructions more reliably. Use these techniques strategically for critical rules.

<keyword_hierarchy>
Use emphasis keywords in order of severity:

| Keyword | Use For | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Non-negotiable rules | `**CRITICAL**: Never commit secrets` |
| **NEVER** | Absolute prohibitions | `NEVER: Push directly to main` |
| **ALWAYS** | Mandatory behaviors | `ALWAYS: Run tests before pushing` |
| **IMPORTANT** | Significant guidance | `IMPORTANT: Keep components under 300 lines` |
| **YOU MUST** | Explicit requirements | `YOU MUST: Use TanStack Form for forms` |
</keyword_hierarchy>

<formatting_patterns>
**Bold + CRITICAL keyword:**
```markdown
**CRITICAL**: Always run tests before pushing code
```

**Capitalized emphasis:**
```markdown
IMPORTANT: Do not commit environment variables
YOU MUST: Follow the git workflow outlined below
NEVER: Include API keys in code
ALWAYS: Use TypeScript strict mode
```

**Strikethrough for forbidden options:**
```markdown
- `pnpm test:ci` - Run tests (use this)
- ~~`pnpm test`~~ - NEVER use (interactive mode)
```

**Visual markers (use sparingly):**
```markdown
⚠️ WARNING: This affects production data
🔒 SECURITY: Never commit secrets to git
```
</formatting_patterns>

<placement_strategy>
Order matters. Claude pays more attention to:

1. **First items** in each section (put critical rules first)
2. **Repeated items** across sections (repeat critical rules in context)
3. **Emphasized items** with CRITICAL/NEVER/ALWAYS keywords

Structure your file with critical rules first:

```markdown
## Code Conventions

### Critical Rules
- **NEVER** commit .env files
- **ALWAYS** run tests before pushing
- **CRITICAL**: Use TanStack Form for ALL forms

### General Guidelines
- Prefer Server Components
- Keep components under 300 lines
```
</placement_strategy>

<repetition_for_emphasis>
For extremely important rules, repeat in multiple relevant contexts:

```markdown
## Forms
**CRITICAL**: Use TanStack Form for ALL forms

## Before Editing
- **CRITICAL**: Use TanStack Form for forms

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Forms use TanStack Form (**CRITICAL**)
```
</repetition_for_emphasis>
</emphasis_techniques>

<writing_effective_instructions>
<golden_rule>
Show your CLAUDE.md to someone with minimal project context. If they're confused, Claude will be too.
</golden_rule>

<be_specific>
Vague instructions cause inconsistent behavior:

```markdown
❌ VAGUE:
- Format code properly
- Write good tests
- Follow best practices

✅ SPECIFIC:
- Run `pnpm lint` before committing (Prettier configured)
- Write tests in `__tests__/` using Vitest
- Use TanStack Form for all forms (see `src/features/form/`)
```
</be_specific>

<show_dont_tell>
When format matters, show examples:

```markdown
❌ TELLING:
Use conventional commits with type and description.

✅ SHOWING:
## Commit Format
```
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation
```
Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore
```
</show_dont_tell>

<eliminate_ambiguity>
Replace vague phrases with clear directives:

| Ambiguous | Clear Alternative |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Try to..." | "Always..." or "Never..." |
| "Should probably..." | "Must..." or "May optionally..." |
| "Generally..." | "Always... except when [condition]" |
| "Consider..." | "If [condition], then [action]" |
</eliminate_ambiguity>

<define_edge_cases>
Anticipate questions and answer them:

```markdown
❌ INCOMPLETE:
Run tests before pushing.

✅ COMPLETE:
## Testing
- Run `pnpm test:ci` before pushing
- If tests fail, fix before committing
- New features require tests in `__tests__/`
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
```
</define_edge_cases>

<provide_decision_criteria>
When Claude must make choices, give criteria:

```markdown
## Component Choice

**Use Server Component when:**
- Data fetching only
- No user interaction needed

**Use Client Component when:**
- User interaction required
- Browser APIs needed (localStorage, window)
```
</provide_decision_criteria>

<separate_obligation_levels>
Clearly distinguish requirements from suggestions:

```markdown
## API Development

### Must Have
- Input validation with Zod
- Error handling for all endpoints

### Nice to Have
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Caching headers

### Must Not
- Expose internal errors to clients
- Log sensitive data
```
</separate_obligation_levels>
</writing_effective_instructions>

<size_constraints>
<limits>
- **Ideal**: 100-200 lines maximum
- **Practical max**: 300 lines before splitting
- **Universal items**: Under 60 lines

**Why these limits matter:**
- Claude reliably follows ~150-200 total instructions
- Claude Code's system prompt uses ~50 instructions
- Leaves ~100-150 slots for YOUR instructions
- Irrelevant content degrades instruction-following
</limits>

<scaling_strategy>
When exceeding limits:

1. Move task-specific details to separate files
2. Link from CLAUDE.md with descriptions
3. Use progressive disclosure pattern

```markdown
## Detailed Guides
- **API Routes**: See [docs/api-patterns.md](docs/api-patterns.md)
- **Testing**: See [docs/testing-guide.md](docs/testing-guide.md)
- **Deployment**: See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)
```
</scaling_strategy>
</size_constraints>

<imports_feature>
CLAUDE.md supports importing other markdown files:

```markdown
## External References
@docs/coding-standards.md
@~/.claude/my-global-preferences.md
@./team-conventions.md
```

<import_rules>
- Supports relative and absolute paths
- Home directory expansion with `~`
- Recursive imports up to 5 levels deep
- NOT evaluated inside code blocks or backticks
</import_rules>
</imports_feature>

<anti_patterns>
<never_include>
**Code Style Rules** - Use linters instead (LLMs are expensive, linters are free)

**Secrets** - NEVER include API keys, database URLs, tokens, credentials

**Too Much Content** - Link to docs instead of embedding 500+ lines

**Extensive Code** - Reference files instead (code examples become outdated)

**Vague Instructions** - Be specific (see `<writing_effective_instructions>`)
</never_include>

<examples_what_to_avoid>
```markdown
❌ BAD:
- Use 2-space indentation (use Prettier instead)
- DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (never include secrets)
- [500 lines of API docs] (link to external file)
- Format code properly (too vague)

✅ GOOD:
- ESLint/Prettier configured (see .eslintrc)
- Credentials in `.env` (never committed)
- API guide: See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md)
- Run `pnpm lint` before committing
```
</examples_what_to_avoid>
</anti_patterns>

<examples>
For complete examples, see reference files:

- **Minimal example**: [references/section-templates.md](references/section-templates.md) (templates section)
- **Comprehensive SaaS**: [references/comprehensive-example.md](references/comprehensive-example.md)
- **Project-specific**: [references/project-patterns.md](references/project-patterns.md) (Next.js, Express, Python, Monorepo)
</examples>

<workflow>
<decision_point>
**ALWAYS ASK FIRST: Storage Strategy**

Before creating or updating memory files, ask the user:

> Do you want to use a single CLAUDE.md file or split into separate `.claude/rules/` files?
>
> **Option 1: Single CLAUDE.md** - All instructions in one file (simpler, best for small projects)
> **Option 2: Modular .claude/rules/** - Split by concern with optional path-scoping (better for large projects)

Use AskUserQuestion to present these options before proceeding.

**Decision guide:**
- **Choose CLAUDE.md** if: < 100 lines of instructions, simple project, universal rules
- **Choose .claude/rules/** if: 100+ lines, multiple file types with different rules, team maintains different areas
</decision_point>

<creating_new>
**Creating New Memory (CLAUDE.md approach)**

1. Start with `/init` or minimal template
2. Add tech stack and commands first
3. Add conventions as you encounter friction
4. Test with real tasks
5. Iterate based on Claude's behavior
</creating_new>

<creating_rules>
**Creating New Memory (.claude/rules/ approach)**

1. Create `.claude/rules/` directory
2. Start with one file per major concern:
   - `general.md` - Universal project rules
   - `testing.md` - Testing conventions
   - `code-style.md` - Code conventions
3. Add path-scoped rules as needed:
   ```yaml
   ---
   paths: src/api/**/*.ts
   ---
   # API rules here
   ```
4. Test with real tasks in different file contexts
5. Split or merge files based on usage patterns
</creating_rules>

<maintaining>
**Maintaining Memory Files**

1. Review quarterly (or when project changes significantly)
2. Remove outdated instructions
3. Add patterns that required repeated explanation
4. Keep CLAUDE.md under 200 lines (or split to .claude/rules/)
5. Use `#` for quick additions during work
</maintaining>

<migrating_to_rules>
**Migrating from CLAUDE.md to .claude/rules/**

When CLAUDE.md exceeds 200 lines:

1. Identify distinct sections (testing, API, frontend, etc.)
2. Create `.claude/rules/` directory
3. Move each section to its own file
4. Add `paths` frontmatter where rules are file-type specific
5. Keep only universal essentials in CLAUDE.md (or delete it)
6. Test to ensure rules load correctly
</migrating_to_rules>

<troubleshooting>
**Common Issues**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Claude ignores instructions | Reduce file size, add emphasis (CRITICAL, NEVER) |
| Context overflow | Use `/clear`, split into .claude/rules/ files |
| Outdated information | Review quarterly, remove stale content |
| Instructions conflict | Consolidate, use hierarchy (root vs subtree) |
| Rules not loading | Check file is `.md`, in correct directory |
| Path rules not applying | Verify glob pattern matches target files |
</troubleshooting>
</workflow>

<advanced_features>
<local_overrides>
Use `CLAUDE.local.md` for personal preferences (auto-gitignored):
- Personal shortcuts and aliases
- Editor-specific settings
- Local testing commands
</local_overrides>

<settings_integration>
CLAUDE.md works alongside `settings.json`:
- `settings.json`: Permissions, allowed tools, environment variables
- `CLAUDE.md`: Context, conventions, workflow instructions
</settings_integration>

<progressive_disclosure>
For complex projects, link to detailed docs. Claude only loads when relevant:

```markdown
## References
- **Database**: See [docs/database.md](docs/database.md)
- **API**: See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md)
```
</progressive_disclosure>
</advanced_features>

<success_criteria>
A well-crafted Claude memory system:

**For CLAUDE.md approach:**
- Loads in under 200 lines
- Contains only project-specific context (not general knowledge)
- Uses emphasis for critical rules (CRITICAL, NEVER, ALWAYS)
- Avoids code style rules (use linters)
- Contains NO secrets or credentials
- Provides clear commands for common tasks
- Follows WHAT-WHY-HOW structure

**For .claude/rules/ approach:**
- Each file focused on one concern (testing, API, security, etc.)
- Path-scoped rules use accurate glob patterns
- No duplicate rules across files
- Files organized in logical subdirectories
- Symlinks used for shared rules across projects

**Both approaches:**
- Gets updated as project evolves
- Improves Claude's first-try accuracy on tasks
- User was asked which approach they prefer before implementation
</success_criteria>
