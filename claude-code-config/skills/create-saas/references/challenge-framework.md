# Smart Validation Framework

Pragmatic validation for indie hackers who want to ship fast BUT make smart decisions.

**Two modes:** Pick your speed.

---

## Choose Your Path

### 🚀 Speed Mode (Ship in 1-2 weeks)

**Best for:**
- Scratching your own itch
- Side projects
- Learning projects
- Low-stakes experiments

**Validation approach:**
1. Quick competitor check (30 min)
2. Build MVP
3. Ship to 10 people
4. Learn from real usage

### 🎯 Thorough Mode (Ship in 2-4 weeks)

**Best for:**
- Planning to monetize seriously
- Quitting job for this
- Significant time investment
- Competitive market

**Validation approach:**
1. Competitor deep-dive
2. Talk to 5-10 potential users
3. Test with landing page
4. Build with confidence

---

## Quick Sanity Check (Both Modes)

Before building, answer these 5 questions honestly:

### 1. Would YOU use this?

| Answer | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| "Hell yes, daily" | 🟢 Great — you understand the user |
| "Sometimes, maybe" | 🟡 Okay — but make sure others need it too |
| "No, but others would" | 🟠 Risky — hard to build for users you don't understand |

### 2. Can you explain it in one sentence?

**Test:** Tell someone in 10 seconds what it does.

✅ Good: "Notion for meal planning"
✅ Good: "Auto-post to Twitter when you ship on GitHub"
❌ Bad: "A platform that leverages AI to optimize workflow synergies"

### 3. Who else has tried this?

| Competitors | What it means | Action |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 0 | Either genius or no market | Proceed with caution |
| 1-3 | Sweet spot — validated, room to win | Go for it |
| 5-10 | Crowded — need an angle | Find your niche |
| 10+ | Very crowded | Need 10x better at ONE thing |

### 4. How hard is this to build?

| Complexity | Examples | Reality check |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 🟢 Easy | CRUD app, forms, basic auth | 1-2 weeks with Claude Code |
| 🟡 Medium | Integrations, payments, real-time | 2-4 weeks |
| 🔴 Hard | AI/ML, complex algorithms, scale | Might be too ambitious for MVP |

### 5. How will you reach users?

| Channel | Effort | Good for |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Your own audience | 🟢 Low | If you have one |
| Communities (Reddit, Discord) | 🟢 Low | Niche products |
| Twitter/LinkedIn build in public | 🟡 Medium | Dev tools, SaaS |
| Content/SEO | 🔴 High (slow) | Long-term play |
| Paid ads | 🔴 High (expensive) | Only if you have budget |

## Speed Mode: 30-Minute Validation

### Step 1: Quick Competitor Search (15 min)

Search for:
- "{problem} tool"
- "{solution} app"
- "alternative to {similar product}"

**Find 3-5 competitors. For each, note:**
- Name + URL
- Pricing (free? $X/month?)
- What they do well
- What reviews complain about ← **Your opportunity**

### Step 2: Gut Check (5 min)

Answer honestly:
- [ ] I would use this myself
- [ ] I can build MVP in 2 weeks
- [ ] I know where to find first 10 users
- [ ] It's okay if this fails (learning experience)

**If 3+ checked → Build it.**

### Step 3: Define MVP Scope (10 min)

Write down:
1. **THE ONE thing** it must do (core feature)
2. **TWO supporting features** max
3. **Everything else** → v2 (after launch)

---

## Thorough Mode: Deep Validation

### Phase 1: Market Reality Check

**Competitor Analysis (1-2 hours)**

For each competitor, document:

```markdown
## [Competitor Name]
- **URL:**
- **Pricing:** Free / $X/month
- **What they do well:**
- **What users complain about:** (check reviews, Twitter, Reddit)
- **Your angle:** How you'd be different
```

**Where to find competitors:**
- Product Hunt
- AlternativeTo
- G2 / Capterra
- "best {category} tools" Google search
- Reddit: "what do you use for {problem}?"

### Phase 2: Talk to Real People (Optional but valuable)

**You don't need 30 interviews. 5-10 quick chats is enough.**

**The Mom Test approach (simplified):**

Don't ask: "Would you use this?"
Ask instead: "How do you currently handle {problem}?"

Don't ask: "Would you pay $20/month?"
Ask instead: "What have you already tried/paid for?"

**3 questions that work:**
1. "Tell me about the last time you dealt with {problem}"
2. "What's the most annoying part?"
3. "What have you tried? What worked/didn't work?"

### Phase 3: Landing Page Test (Optional)

**Quick validation with a fake door:**

1. Create simple landing page (1-2 hours)
2. Describe what it does + pricing
3. "Get Early Access" button → email signup
4. Share in relevant communities
5. See if anyone signs up

**Good signals:**
- 3-5% of visitors sign up
- People ask "when is this launching?"
- Someone offers to pay early

## Idea Development Template

Once you've done your sanity check, develop the idea:

```markdown
## [Idea Name]

### One-liner
[What it does in one sentence]

### The Problem
[Who has this problem? When does it happen?]

### The Solution
[What's your approach?]

### Target User
[Be specific: "Freelance designers who..." not "designers"]

### Business Model
- [ ] Subscription ($X/month)
- [ ] One-time ($X)
- [ ] Freemium (free + paid tier)
- [ ] Usage-based (pay per X)

### Competitors
1. [Name] - [What they do] - [Your angle vs them]
2. [Name] - [What they do] - [Your angle vs them]

### Why You?
[Why are YOU the right person to build this?]
- Personal experience with the problem?
- Technical skills?
- Existing audience?

### MVP Scope
**Core feature:** [THE ONE thing]
**Supporting:** [2-3 features max]
**NOT in MVP:** [Everything else]

### First 10 Users
[Where will you find them?]
```

## Viability Score (Quick Version)

Rate 1-5 for each:

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Personal interest | /5 | Would you use it? |
| Build feasibility | /5 | Can you ship in 2 weeks? |
| Market exists | /5 | Do competitors exist? People pay? |
| Reach | /5 | Can you find users? |
| Differentiation | /5 | What's your angle? |

**Total: /25**

| Score | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| 20-25 | 🚀 Strong — build it |
| 15-19 | ✅ Good — worth trying |
| 10-14 | 🤔 Okay — consider adjustments |
| <10 | ⚠️ Weak — maybe pivot |

---

## When to Pivot (Be Honest)

**Red flags after shipping:**
- No one uses it after 2 weeks
- You stopped using it yourself
- Can't explain why it's better than alternatives
- No path to first paying customer

**Pivot options:**
1. Same problem, different solution
2. Same solution, different audience
3. Narrow down to specific niche
4. Kill it and try something else (it's okay!)

---

## The Indie Hacker Mindset

### Remember:

✅ **Shipping > Planning** — You learn more from launching than researching
✅ **Small > Big** — Start tiny, expand based on feedback
✅ **Done > Perfect** — v1 can be ugly, v2 can be better
✅ **Fail fast > Fail slow** — If it's not working, pivot quickly
✅ **Fun matters** — Build something you're excited about

### It's okay if:

- Your first idea fails (most do)
- Only 10 people use it (that's 10 real users!)
- You pivot 3 times (normal)
- It never makes money (you learned a ton)

### What matters:

- You shipped something
- You learned what users want
- You improved your skills
- You're ready for the next one
