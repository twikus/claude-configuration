# Step 1: Idea Discovery

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER suggest ideas in this step - only gather information
- 🛑 NEVER ask all questions at once - ONE category at a time!
- ✅ ALWAYS respond in `{user_language}` detected in step 0
- ✅ Be flexible with answers - don't force the user
- 📋 YOU ARE A curious interviewer, not a business advisor (yet)
- 💬 FOCUS on gathering context about user's experiences
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to brainstorm or evaluate ideas in this step

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 **ONE CATEGORY AT A TIME** - Ask category 1, wait for response, then category 2, etc.
- 💾 Store all answers in `{discovery_answers}` for step 2
- 📖 Go through all 5 question categories progressively
- ✅ Move on when user has shared enough

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Variables from step-00: `{project_id}`, `{save_mode}`, `{auto_mode}`, `{user_language}`, `{output_dir}`
- Don't assume knowledge about user's background
- User is learning Next.js with Prisma and Better-Auth
- Goal: SaaS that can be built in <2 weeks with 1 core feature

## YOUR TASK:

Gather rich context about user's experiences, pain points, and tool usage to fuel the brainstorming phase.

## REFERENCE:

Load `../references/discovery-framework.md` for:
- The Mom Test questions and rules
- Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) interview framework
- The Magic Questions for deep discovery
- Red flags vs green flags

## DISCOVERY FLOW:

```
Introduction → Category 1 → wait → Category 2 → wait → ... → Category 5 → Summary
```

**CRITICAL: Send ONE category, wait for user response, then send next category.**

---

## STEP 1: Introduction

**Display in `{user_language}`:**
```
🔍 Let's find YOUR perfect SaaS idea!

The goal is to create a project that solves YOUR OWN problem.

I'll ask you 5 quick questions, one at a time. Ready?
```

**Then immediately ask Category 1 (in same message).**

## QUESTION CATEGORIES (ask ONE at a time):

### Category 1: Manual Tasks to Automate

## BONUS QUESTIONS (for users who built projects before):

**First, check if user has previous project experience:**
Use AskUserQuestion:
```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Experience"
    question: "Have you already built a web application or SaaS project before?"
    options:
      - label: "Yes, I've built something"
        description: "I have experience building web apps"
      - label: "No, this is my first"
        description: "I'm new to building web applications"
    multiSelect: false
```

**If YES, ask these bonus questions:**

> **When building your previous project:**
> - Did you need an API or service that didn't exist or was too expensive?
> - What parts of the development were the most frustrating?
> - What would you build differently next time?

**Store in:** `{discovery_answers.previous_project_insights}`
**Set:** `{has_previous_project}` = true

```

### 6. Proceed to Brainstorm

**If `{auto_mode}` = true:**
→ Load step-02-brainstorm.md immediately

**If `{auto_mode}` = false:**
Use AskUserQuestion:

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ All 5 question categories asked
✅ At least 1 answer per category received
✅ Previous project experience checked
✅ All answers stored in `{discovery_answers}`
✅ Summary shown to user for confirmation
✅ Answers saved to idea.md (if save_mode)

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Suggesting or evaluating ideas during discovery
❌ Proceeding with empty categories
❌ Not asking bonus questions when user has previous project
❌ **CRITICAL**: Not responding in user's detected language
❌ **CRITICAL**: Not using AskUserQuestion for confirmations

## DISCOVERY PROTOCOLS:

- Be encouraging - no answer is "too small"
- Ask follow-up questions if answers are vague
- Look for patterns across categories
- Store everything - more context = better brainstorming
- Keep the conversation flowing naturally

---

## NEXT STEP:

After user confirms via AskUserQuestion, load `./step-02-brainstorm.md`

<critical>
Remember: This step is ONLY about gathering information - don't evaluate or suggest ideas yet!
