# Step 5: Technical Architecture

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER recommend tools not in the approved stack without justification
- ✅ ALWAYS base decisions on PRD requirements
- ✅ ALWAYS respond in `{user_language}`
- 📋 YOU ARE A solutions architect, making practical decisions
- 💬 FOCUS on what the PRD requires, not hypothetical future needs
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to over-engineer - keep it simple for solo dev

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Read PRD first, then map features to technical needs
- 💾 Reference nowts project and tools.md for stack decisions
- 📖 Every tool choice needs "Why" and "Trade-off"
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load step-06 until architecture is validated

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Variables from previous steps: `{validated_idea}`, `{prd_content}`, `{user_language}`, `{output_dir}`, `{save_mode}`
- Base project: NOW.TS boilerplate (user provides path in step-07)

## REFERENCE:

Load `../references/tools.md` for:
- Recommended tech stack
- Tool decision matrix
- Cost estimation templates

Load `../references/architecture-template.md` for:
- Architecture document structure
- Common patterns
- Folder structure

## YOUR TASK:

Design the technical architecture that implements the PRD, using the nowts stack as a foundation.

---

## PHASE 0: RESEARCH & UNDERSTANDING

**Before making any technical decisions, research the available tools:**

### Research NOW.TS Features

**🚨 IMPORTANT: If the PRD requires auth, payments, organizations, or multi-tenant features, you DON'T need to build them - they're already in NOW.TS!**

### Research Upstash Suite (For Real-Time & Background Jobs)

If PRD requires real-time features, background jobs, or messaging, consider the Upstash suite:

**Upstash Realtime (for real-time chat, notifications, etc.):**
- 100% HTTP-based with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Built-in message histories
- Automatic connection management with delivery guarantee
- Type-safe with Zod schemas
- 2.6kB gzipped, zero dependencies
- Perfect for Next.js serverless
- **Use Case**: Real-time chat, live notifications, collaborative features

**Upstash QStash (for background jobs, scheduling, messaging):**
- Serverless messaging and scheduling
- Automatic retries on failure
- CRON-based scheduling
- Message delays up to 90 days
- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed messages
- Deduplication
- Rate limiting and parallelism control
- Fan-out to multiple endpoints
- **Use Cases**: Background jobs, scheduled tasks, webhooks, async processing, email queues, LLM workflows

**Upstash Redis (for caching, rate limiting):**
- Serverless Redis
- Global low latency
- Perfect for caching, sessions, rate limiting

**Upstash Vector (for AI/semantic search):**
- Vector database for embeddings
- Semantic search capabilities

## ARCHITECTURE PROCESS:

### Phase 1: PRD to Technical Requirements

**FIRST: Check what NOW.TS already provides:**

Go through the PRD feature list and mark what's already built:

| PRD Feature | NOW.TS Status | Additional Work Needed? |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| User authentication | ✅ Built-in | Just configure auth methods |
| Payment/subscriptions | ✅ Built-in | Configure Stripe products |
| Organizations/teams | ✅ Built-in | Customize if needed |
| Email notifications | ✅ Built-in | Create email templates |
| {custom feature} | ❌ Need to build | {technical approach} |

**🎯 CRITICAL: If a feature is built-in to NOW.TS, don't plan to rebuild it! Just plan to configure it.**

**SECOND: Map remaining features to technical needs:**

| PRD Feature | Technical Requirement |
|-------------|----------------------|
| {feature 1} | {what's needed technically} |
| {feature 2} | {what's needed technically} |
| {feature 3} | {what's needed technically} |

**THIRD: Identify special needs beyond NOW.TS:**

- **Real-time features?** → Consider Upstash Realtime (SSE)
  - Chat, live notifications, collaborative editing
  - Example: Real-time chat widget, live dashboard updates

- **Background jobs?** → Consider Upstash QStash
  - Scheduled tasks, async processing, retries
  - Example: Daily reports, email queues, webhook processing

- **File uploads?** → Need storage solution
  - Consider Vercel Blob Storage or S3

- **AI features?** → NOW.TS has AI SDK ready
  - Easy to integrate OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.

- **Heavy computation?** → May need background processing
  - Use QStash for async jobs

### Phase 2: Stack Decisions

**For each technical decision, ask:**
1. Is this already in NOW.TS? → Use it!
2. Does PRD require this?
3. What's the simplest solution?
4. What's the trade-off?

**🚨 IMPORTANT: Only ask about features NOT already in NOW.TS!**

**Authentication** - ✅ Already in NOW.TS with Better Auth
- Just configure which methods to enable (email/password, OAuth, magic link)
- Don't ask about auth provider - it's Better Auth

**Payments** - ✅ Already in NOW.TS with Stripe
- Just configure Stripe products and pricing
- Don't ask about payment provider - it's Stripe

**Organizations/Multi-tenant** - ✅ Already in NOW.TS
- Just customize if needed
- Don't rebuild this!

**Real-Time Features** - ❌ Need to decide

If PRD requires real-time (chat, live updates, notifications):

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Real-time"
    question: "You need real-time features. Which approach?"
    options:
      - label: "Upstash Realtime (Recommended)"
        description: "SSE-based, 2.6kB, type-safe, perfect for Next.js serverless"
      - label: "Polling"
        description: "Simple but higher latency and server load"
      - label: "WebSockets (Custom)"
        description: "More complex, need separate server"
    multiSelect: false
```

**Background Jobs** - ❌ Need to decide

If PRD requires scheduled tasks, async processing, or retries:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Background Jobs"
    question: "You need background job processing. Which approach?"
    options:
      - label: "Upstash QStash (Recommended)"
        description: "Serverless, auto-retry, scheduling, perfect for Vercel"
      - label: "Vercel Cron"
        description: "Simple scheduled tasks only, no retries"
      - label: "BullMQ / Redis Queue"
        description: "Full-featured but need Redis server"
    multiSelect: false
```

**File Storage** - ❌ Need to decide

If PRD requires file uploads:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Storage"
    question: "Where to store uploaded files?"
    options:
      - label: "Vercel Blob (Recommended)"
        description: "Integrated with Vercel, simple API"
      - label: "AWS S3"
        description: "Most flexible, requires AWS setup"
      - label: "Cloudinary"
        description: "Great for images, auto-optimization"
    multiSelect: false
```

**Database** - Usually Neon + Prisma (already in NOW.TS)

Only ask if PRD has special requirements:

```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Database"
    question: "Special database needs detected. Which approach?"
    options:
      - label: "Neon + Prisma (Recommended)"
        description: "Standard PostgreSQL, already in NOW.TS"
      - label: "Supabase"
        description: "PostgreSQL + real-time + storage built-in"
    multiSelect: false
```

### Phase 3: Generate Architecture Document

**Create `{output_dir}/archi.md`:**

```markdown

project_id: {project_id}
created: {timestamp}
status: complete
stepsCompleted: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES

### Upstash Realtime Implementation

**When to use:** Real-time chat, live notifications, collaborative features

**Setup (5 minutes):**

```typescript
// 1. Install
npm install @upstash/realtime

// 2. Define events (lib/realtime.ts)
import { Realtime } from "@upstash/realtime";
import { z } from "zod";

export const events = {
  "message.created": z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    content: z.string(),
    senderId: z.string(),
    conversationId: z.string(),
    timestamp: z.number(),
  }),
  "user.typing": z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    conversationId: z.string(),
  }),
};

export const realtime = new Realtime(events, {
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_REALTIME_TOKEN!,
});

// 3. Route handler (app/api/realtime/route.ts)
import { realtime } from "@/lib/realtime";

export async function GET() {
  return realtime.handle();
}

// 4. Publish from Server Action (actions/messages.ts)
"use server";

import { realtime } from "@/lib/realtime";

export async function sendMessage(content: string, conversationId: string) {
  // Save to DB
  const message = await prisma.message.create({...});

  // Publish real-time event
  await realtime.publish("message.created", {
    id: message.id,
    content: message.content,
    senderId: message.senderId,
    conversationId,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  });

  return message;
}

// 5. Subscribe from Client (components/chat.tsx)
"use client";

import { useRealtime } from "@upstash/realtime/react";

export function Chat({ conversationId }: { conversationId: string }) {
  const { data: newMessage } = useRealtime("message.created", {
    filter: (msg) => msg.conversationId === conversationId,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (newMessage) {
      // Add message to UI
      setMessages((prev) => [...prev, newMessage]);
    }
  }, [newMessage]);

  return <div>{/* Chat UI */}</div>;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ SSE (Server-Sent Events) - no WebSocket needed
- ✅ Type-safe with Zod
- ✅ Automatic reconnection
- ✅ 2.6kB bundle size
- ✅ Works perfectly on Vercel serverless

---

### Upstash QStash Implementation

**When to use:** Background jobs, scheduled tasks, async processing, retries

**Setup (5 minutes):**

```typescript
// 1. Install
npm install @upstash/qstash

// 2. Create client (lib/qstash.ts)
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";

export const qstash = new Client({
  token: process.env.QSTASH_TOKEN!,
});

// 3. API endpoint for job processing (app/api/jobs/send-welcome-email/route.ts)
import { qstash } from "@/lib/qstash";
import { sendEmail } from "@/lib/email";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Verify request is from QStash
  const signature = req.headers.get("upstash-signature");
  const isValid = await qstash.verify({ signature, body: await req.text() });

  if (!isValid) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }

  const { userId, email } = await req.json();

  // Process job
  await sendEmail({
    to: email,
    subject: "Welcome!",
    template: "welcome",
  });

  return new Response("OK");
}

// 4. Publish job from Server Action (actions/users.ts)
"use server";

import { qstash } from "@/lib/qstash";

export async function createUser(email: string) {
  const user = await prisma.user.create({ data: { email } });

  // Send welcome email asynchronously with retry
  await qstash.publishJSON({
    url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/api/jobs/send-welcome-email`,
    body: {
      userId: user.id,
      email: user.email,
    },
    retries: 3, // Retry 3 times on failure
  });

  return user;
}

// 5. Schedule recurring job (scripts/schedule-daily-report.ts)
import { qstash } from "@/lib/qstash";

await qstash.schedules.create({
  destination: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/api/jobs/daily-report`,
  cron: "0 9 * * *", // Every day at 9 AM
  body: { type: "daily-report" },
});

// 6. Delayed job (actions/trial-reminder.ts)
"use server";

import { qstash } from "@/lib/qstash";

export async function startTrial(userId: string) {
  // Send reminder in 7 days
  await qstash.publishJSON({
    url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/api/jobs/trial-reminder`,
    body: { userId },
    delay: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days in seconds
  });
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- ✅ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed jobs
- ✅ CRON scheduling
- ✅ Delayed execution (up to 90 days)
- ✅ No infrastructure to manage
- ✅ Perfect for Vercel serverless

**Use Cases:**
- Welcome emails after signup
- Daily/weekly reports
- Trial expiration reminders
- Webhook processing
- Data exports
- LLM API calls (with retry logic)

questions:
  - header: "Approve"
    question: "Does this architecture look good for your project?"
    options:
      - label: "Yes, let's create tasks (Recommended)"
        description: "Architecture approved, create implementation tasks"
      - label: "I have questions"
        description: "I want to discuss some decisions"
      - label: "Need changes"
        description: "Some decisions need to be different"
    multiSelect: false
```

---

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ All PRD features mapped to technical implementation
✅ Stack decisions justified with "Why" and trade-offs
✅ Folder structure defined
✅ Cost estimation included
✅ Implementation order defined
✅ Architecture saved to archi.md (if save_mode)
✅ User explicitly approved architecture

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Over-engineering beyond PRD requirements
❌ Using tools not in approved stack without justification
❌ Missing cost estimation
❌ No implementation order
❌ **CRITICAL**: Not using AskUserQuestion for approval
❌ **CRITICAL**: Not responding in user's detected language

## ARCHITECTURE PROTOCOLS:

- Start with nowts stack, only add what's needed
- Every tool choice needs justification
- Simple is better than clever
- Cost matters for solo devs
- Implementation order helps with planning

---

## NEXT STEP:

After user approves architecture via AskUserQuestion, load `./step-06-tasks.md`

<critical>
🚀 NOW.TS ADVANTAGE:
- Auth, payments, organizations, email, analytics = ALREADY BUILT
- Don't plan to rebuild what's already there
- Focus architecture on UNIQUE features only
- Timeline is much shorter because foundation is done!

Remember:
- The goal is to define HOW to build what the PRD specifies
- Check NOW.TS first before adding any service
- Upstash Realtime for real-time → SSE-based, perfect for serverless
- Upstash QStash for background jobs → auto-retry, scheduling, async
- Solo dev + NOW.TS = 2-7 day timeline is realistic!
</critical>
