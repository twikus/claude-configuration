# Step 6: Task Creation

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER create vague tasks - each must be actionable
- ✅ ALWAYS base tasks on PRD features and Architecture
- ✅ ALWAYS respond in `{user_language}`
- 📋 YOU ARE A project manager, breaking work into doable chunks
- 💬 FOCUS on tasks that can be done in 1-4 hours each
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to create tasks not traceable to PRD/Architecture

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Create tasks folder with numbered task files
- 💾 Each task has: context, requirements, acceptance criteria
- 📖 Tasks should be completable by Claude Code
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip task file creation (if save_mode)

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Variables from previous steps: `{validated_idea}`, `{prd_content}`, `{architecture}`, `{user_language}`, `{output_dir}`, `{save_mode}`
- Tasks should reference PRD features and Architecture decisions

## REFERENCE:

Load `../references/task-template.md` for:
- Task file structure
- Standard task categories
- Task sizing guide
- Acceptance criteria patterns

## YOUR TASK:

Create a structured set of implementation tasks that Claude Code can execute to build the MVP.

---

## TASK STRUCTURE:

### Task File Template

Each task file follows this structure:

```markdown
---
task_id: {NN}
title: {Task Title}
status: pending
priority: P0|P1|P2
estimated_hours: {1-4}
prd_features: [{feature references}]
archi_sections: [{architecture references}]
depends_on: [{task_ids}]
---

# Task {NN}: {Title}

## Context

{Brief context from PRD and Architecture - what this task is building and why}

## Requirements

- [ ] {Specific requirement 1}
- [ ] {Specific requirement 2}
- [ ] {Specific requirement 3}

## Technical Details

{Any specific technical instructions from Architecture}

**Files to create/modify:**
- `{file path 1}` - {purpose}
- `{file path 2}` - {purpose}

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] {Criterion 1 - testable}
- [ ] {Criterion 2 - testable}

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Analyze PRD and Architecture

**Extract from PRD:**
- All must-have features
- User flows
- Pages required

**Extract from Architecture:**
- Implementation order
- Technical decisions
- Folder structure

### 2. Create Tasks Folder

**If `{save_mode}` = true:**

```bash
mkdir -p {output_dir}/tasks
```

### 3. Generate Task Files

**Create each task file:**

**`{output_dir}/tasks/01-project-setup.md`:**
```markdown
---
task_id: 01
title: Project Setup
status: pending
priority: P0
estimated_hours: 1
prd_features: []
archi_sections: ["Foundation"]
depends_on: []
---

# Task 01: Project Setup

## Context

Set up the Next.js project with the nowts stack. This is the foundation for {Product Name}.

## Requirements

- [ ] Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- [ ] Install core dependencies (Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up basic folder structure per Architecture

## Technical Details

**Based on Architecture:**
- Use App Router
- Configure Tailwind CSS v4
- Initialize shadcn/ui

**Files to create:**
- `.env.local` - environment variables
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind configuration
- `components.json` - shadcn configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pnpm dev` runs without errors
- [ ] Tailwind styles work
- [ ] shadcn/ui components can be added
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors

## Notes

Use NOW.TS boilerplate as reference for stack patterns
```

**Continue for all tasks based on PRD features...**

### 4. Create Task Overview

**Generate `{output_dir}/tasks/README.md`:**

```markdown
# Implementation Tasks: {Product Name}

## Overview

Total tasks: {N}
Estimated total hours: {X}
Suggested timeline: {Y} days

## Task List

| # | Task | Priority | Hours | Depends On | Status |
|---|------|----------|-------|------------|--------|
| 01 | Project Setup | P0 | 1 | - | ⬜ |
| 02 | Database Setup | P0 | 2 | 01 | ⬜ |
| 03 | Authentication | P0 | 3 | 02 | ⬜ |
| 04 | {Core Feature} - Data | P0 | 3 | 03 | ⬜ |
| 05 | {Core Feature} - UI | P0 | 4 | 04 | ⬜ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ⬜ |

## Dependency Graph

```
01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06
                ↓
               07 → 08
                    ↓
                   10 → 11 → 12
                         ↓
                        15
```

## How to Use

1. Work through tasks in order (respecting dependencies)
2. Use Claude Code to implement each task
3. Mark tasks as done: ⬜ → ✅
4. Reference PRD and Architecture for context

## Status Legend

- ⬜ Pending
- 🔄 In Progress
- ✅ Complete
- ⏸️ Blocked
```

### 5. Present Summary

**Display in `{user_language}`:**
```
📋 Tasks Created for {Product Name}

Total: {N} tasks
Estimated: {X} hours (~{Y} days)

Task breakdown:
- Foundation: {X} tasks ({Y} hours)
- Core Feature: {X} tasks ({Y} hours)
- Supporting: {X} tasks ({Y} hours)
- Polish: {X} tasks ({Y} hours)

Files created:
- tasks/README.md - Overview & tracking
- tasks/01-project-setup.md
- tasks/02-database-setup.md
- ... (all task files)

Suggested workflow:
1. Start with task 01, work sequentially
2. Use /apex or Claude Code for each task
3. Reference PRD.md and ARCHI.md for context
4. Update task status as you complete them
```

### 6. Provide Next Steps

**Display in `{user_language}`:**
```
🎉 SaaS Planning Complete!

You now have everything you need to build {Product Name}:

📁 Output folder: {output_dir}/
- idea.md - Validated idea with research
- prd.md - Product Requirements Document
- archi.md - Technical Architecture
- tasks/ - Implementation tasks

To start building:
1. Open the tasks folder
2. Start with 01-project-setup.md
3. Use Claude Code: "Implement task 01 from {output_dir}/tasks/01-project-setup.md"
4. Work through tasks in order

Pro tips:
- Keep PRD and Architecture open for reference
- Mark tasks ✅ as you complete them
- Ship fast, iterate based on feedback

Good luck building {Product Name}! 🚀
```

### 7. Workflow Complete

**Update all document frontmatters with `stepsCompleted: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`**

**Final AskUserQuestion (optional):**
```yaml
questions:
  - header: "Start"
    question: "Would you like me to start implementing the first task?"
    options:
      - label: "Yes, start task 01"
        description: "Begin project setup immediately"
      - label: "No, I'll do it myself"
        description: "I'll implement tasks on my own"
      - label: "Review documents first"
        description: "Let me review the generated docs"
    multiSelect: false
```

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ All PRD features have corresponding tasks
✅ Tasks are in logical order with dependencies
✅ Each task is 1-4 hours of work
✅ Each task has clear acceptance criteria
✅ README.md with overview and tracking
✅ All task files created (if save_mode)

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Creating vague tasks like "Build the app"
❌ Tasks not traceable to PRD features
❌ Missing dependencies between tasks
❌ Tasks too large (>4 hours)
❌ No acceptance criteria
❌ **CRITICAL**: Not creating task files when save_mode is true

## TASK CREATION PROTOCOLS:

- Every task must be actionable by Claude Code
- Include file paths where possible
- Reference PRD and Architecture sections
- Keep tasks focused on one thing
- Clear acceptance criteria = can be verified

---

**This is the final step of the create-saas workflow.**

The user now has:
1. ✅ Validated idea with market research
2. ✅ Product Requirements Document
3. ✅ Technical Architecture
4. ✅ Implementation tasks

**Output folder structure:**
```
~/.claude/output/saas/{project_id}/
├── idea.md
├── prd.md
├── archi.md
├── marketing.md
└── tasks/
    ├── README.md
    ├── 01-project-setup.md
