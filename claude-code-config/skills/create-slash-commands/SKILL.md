description: Expert guidance for creating Claude Code slash commands. Use when working with slash commands, creating custom commands, understanding command structure, or learning YAML configuration.
---

<objective>
Create effective slash commands for Claude Code that enable users to trigger reusable prompts with `/command-name` syntax. Slash commands expand as prompts in the current conversation, allowing teams to standardize workflows and operations.

Commands can be **global** (available everywhere in `~/.claude/commands/`) or **project-specific** (shared with team in `.claude/commands/`). This skill teaches you to structure commands with XML tags, YAML frontmatter, dynamic context loading, and intelligent argument handling.
</objective>

<quick_start>

<workflow>
1. Create `.claude/commands/` directory (project) or use `~/.claude/commands/` (personal)
2. Create `command-name.md` file
3. Add YAML frontmatter (at minimum: `description`)
4. Write command prompt
5. Test with `/command-name [args]`
</workflow>

<example>
**File**: `.claude/commands/optimize.md`

```markdown
---
description: Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations
---

Analyze the performance of this code and suggest three specific optimizations:
```

**Usage**: `/optimize`

Claude receives the expanded prompt and analyzes the code in context.
</example>
</quick_start>

<xml_structure>
All generated slash commands should use XML tags in the body (after YAML frontmatter) for clarity and consistency.

<required_tags>

**`<objective>`** - What the command does and why it matters
```markdown
<objective>
What needs to happen and why this matters.
Context about who uses this and what it accomplishes.
</objective>
```

**`<process>` or `<steps>`** - How to execute the command
```markdown
<process>
Sequential steps to accomplish the objective:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Final step
</process>
```

**`<success_criteria>`** - How to know the command succeeded
```markdown
<success_criteria>
Clear, measurable criteria for successful completion.
</success_criteria>
```
</required_tags>

<conditional_tags>

**`<context>`** - When loading dynamic state or files
```markdown
<context>
Current state: ! `git status`
Relevant files: @ package.json
</context>
```
(Note: Remove the space after @ in actual usage)

**`<verification>`** - When producing artifacts that need checking
```markdown
<verification>
Before completing, verify:
- Specific test or check to perform
- How to confirm it works
</verification>
```

**`<testing>`** - When running tests is part of the workflow
```markdown
<testing>
Run tests: ! `npm test`
Check linting: ! `npm run lint`
</testing>
```

**`<output>`** - When creating/modifying specific files
```markdown
<output>
Files created/modified:
- `./path/to/file.ext` - Description
</output>
```
</conditional_tags>

<structure_example>

```markdown
---
name: example-command
description: Does something useful
argument-hint: [input]
---

<objective>
Process $ARGUMENTS to accomplish [goal].

This helps [who] achieve [outcome].
</objective>

<context>
Current state: ! `relevant command`
Files: @ relevant/files
</context>

<process>
1. Parse $ARGUMENTS
2. Execute operation
3. Verify results
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Operation completed without errors
- Output matches expected format
</success_criteria>
```
</structure_example>

<intelligence_rules>

**Simple commands** (single operation, no artifacts):
- Required: `<objective>`, `<process>`, `<success_criteria>`
- Example: `/check-todos`, `/first-principles`

**Complex commands** (multi-step, produces artifacts):
- Required: `<objective>`, `<process>`, `<success_criteria>`
- Add: `<context>` (if loading state), `<verification>` (if creating files), `<output>` (what gets created)
- Example: `/commit`, `/create-prompt`, `/run-prompt`

**Commands with dynamic arguments**:
- Use `$ARGUMENTS` in `<objective>` or `<process>` tags
- Include `argument-hint` in frontmatter
- Make it clear what the arguments are for

**Commands that produce files**:
- Always include `<output>` tag specifying what gets created
- Always include `<verification>` tag with checks to perform

**Commands that run tests/builds**:
- Include `<testing>` tag with specific commands
- Include pass/fail criteria in `<success_criteria>`
</intelligence_rules>
</xml_structure>

<arguments_intelligence>
The skill should intelligently determine whether a slash command needs arguments.

<commands_that_need_arguments>

**User provides specific input:**
- `/fix-issue [issue-number]` - Needs issue number
- `/review-pr [pr-number]` - Needs PR number
- `/optimize [file-path]` - Needs file to optimize
- `/commit [type]` - Needs commit type (optional)

**Pattern:** Task operates on user-specified data

Include `argument-hint: [description]` in frontmatter and reference `$ARGUMENTS` in the body.
</commands_that_need_arguments>

<commands_without_arguments>

**Self-contained procedures:**
- `/check-todos` - Operates on known file (TO-DOS.md)
- `/first-principles` - Operates on current conversation
- `/whats-next` - Analyzes current context

**Pattern:** Task operates on implicit context (current conversation, known files, project state)

Omit `argument-hint` and don't reference `$ARGUMENTS`.
</commands_without_arguments>

<incorporating_arguments>

**In `<objective>` tag:**
```markdown
<objective>
Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following project conventions.

This ensures bugs are resolved systematically with proper testing.
</objective>
```

**In `<process>` tag:**
```markdown
<process>
1. Understand issue #$ARGUMENTS from issue tracker
2. Locate relevant code
3. Implement fix
4. Add tests
</process>
```

**In `<context>` tag:**
```markdown
<context>
Issue details: @ issues/$ARGUMENTS.md
Related files: ! `grep -r "TODO.*$ARGUMENTS" src/`
</context>
```
(Note: Remove the space after the exclamation mark in actual usage)
</incorporating_arguments>

<positional_arguments>

For structured input, use `$1`, `$2`, `$3`:

```markdown
---
argument-hint: <pr-number> <priority> <assignee>
---

<objective>
Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.
</objective>
```

**Usage:** `/review-pr 456 high alice`
</positional_arguments>
</arguments_intelligence>

<file_structure>

**Project commands**: `.claude/commands/` (in project root)
- Shared with team via version control
- Project-specific workflows
- Shows `(project)` in `/help` list
- Committed to git for team use

**Global commands**: `~/.claude/commands/` (user home directory)
- Available across all your projects
- Personal productivity commands
- Shows `(user)` in `/help` list
- Not shared with team

**File naming**: `command-name.md` → invoked as `/command-name`

**Choosing between global and project**:
- Use **global** for: Personal workflows, general utilities, commands you use everywhere
- Use **project** for: Team workflows, project-specific operations, shared conventions
</file_structure>

<yaml_frontmatter>

<field name="description">
**Required** - Describes what the command does

```yaml
description: Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations
```

Shown in the `/help` command list.
</field>

<field name="allowed-tools">
**Optional** - Restricts which tools Claude can use

```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
```

**Formats**:
- Array: `allowed-tools: [Read, Edit, Write]`
- Single tool: `allowed-tools: SequentialThinking`
- Bash restrictions: `allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*)`

If omitted: All tools available
</field>
</yaml_frontmatter>

<arguments>
<all_arguments_string>

**Command file**: `.claude/commands/fix-issue.md`
```markdown
---
description: Fix issue following coding standards
---

Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards
```

**Usage**: `/fix-issue 123 high-priority`

**Claude receives**: "Fix issue #123 high-priority following our coding standards"
</all_arguments_string>

<positional_arguments_syntax>

**Command file**: `.claude/commands/review-pr.md`
```markdown
---
description: Review PR with priority and assignee
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3
```

**Usage**: `/review-pr 456 high alice`

**Claude receives**: "Review PR #456 with priority high and assign to alice"

See [references/arguments.md](references/arguments.md) for advanced patterns.
</positional_arguments_syntax>
</arguments>

<dynamic_context>

Execute bash commands before the prompt using the exclamation mark prefix directly before backticks (no space between).

**Note:** Examples below show a space after the exclamation mark to prevent execution during skill loading. In actual slash commands, remove the space.

Example:

```markdown
---
description: Create a git commit
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
---

## Context

- Current git status: ! `git status`
- Current git diff: ! `git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: ! `git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: ! `git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

The bash commands execute and their output is included in the expanded prompt.
</dynamic_context>

<file_references>

Use `@` prefix to reference specific files:

```markdown
---
description: Review implementation
---

Review the implementation in @ src/utils/helpers.js
```
(Note: Remove the space after @ in actual usage)

Claude can access the referenced file's contents.
</file_references>

<best_practices>

**1. Always use XML structure**
```yaml
# All slash commands should have XML-structured bodies
```

After frontmatter, use XML tags:
- `<objective>` - What and why (always)
- `<process>` - How to do it (always)
- `<success_criteria>` - Definition of done (always)
- Additional tags as needed (see xml_structure section)

**2. Clear descriptions**
```yaml
# Good
description: Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations

# Bad
description: Optimize stuff
```

**3. Use dynamic context for state-dependent tasks**
```markdown
Current git status: ! `git status`
Files changed: ! `git diff --name-only`
```

**4. Restrict tools when appropriate**
```yaml
# For git commands - prevent running arbitrary bash
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)

# For analysis - thinking only
allowed-tools: SequentialThinking
```

**5. Use $ARGUMENTS for flexibility**
```markdown
Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS
```

**6. Reference relevant files**
```markdown
Review @ package.json for dependencies
Analyze @ src/database/* for schema
```
(Note: Remove the space after @ in actual usage)
</best_practices>

<common_patterns>

**Simple analysis command**:
```markdown
---
description: Review this code for security vulnerabilities
---

<objective>

</success_criteria>
```

**File-specific command**:
```markdown
---
description: Optimize code performance
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

<objective>
Analyze performance of @ $ARGUMENTS and suggest specific optimizations.

This helps improve application performance through targeted improvements.
</objective>

<process>
1. Review code in @ $ARGUMENTS for performance issues
2. Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
3. Suggest three specific optimizations with rationale
4. Estimate performance impact of each
</process>

<success_criteria>

<generation_protocol>

<step_1_analyze_request>
**Analyze the user's request** to understand what they want:

- What is the command's purpose?
- Does it need user input ($ARGUMENTS)?
- Does it produce files or artifacts?
- Does it require verification or testing?
- Is it simple (single-step) or complex (multi-step)?
- What pattern does it match? (see [references/prompt-examples.md](references/prompt-examples.md))

**Intelligence rule**: Only proceed to questions if critical information is missing. If the request is clear, skip directly to format choice.
</step_1_analyze_request>

<step_2_ask_questions_if_needed>
**INTELLIGENCE RULE**: Only ask questions if critical information is truly missing.

If the request is clear, skip directly to scope and format questions. Most requests like "create a command to X" contain enough information to proceed.

**Ask clarifying questions** ONLY if essential information is missing:

Use AskUserQuestion to gather ONLY what's needed:

1. **Command purpose** (if completely unclear):
   - header: "Purpose"
   - question: "What should this command do?"
   - Let user provide via "Other" option

2. **Arguments** (if truly ambiguous - rare):
   - header: "Arguments"
   - question: "Does this command need user input?"
   - options: "Yes - takes arguments", "No - uses context only"

**SKIP questions for**:
- Clear purposes: "create a command to commit and push" → obvious purpose
- Obvious complexity: "simple command to..." vs "command that monitors and fixes..."
- Clear arguments: "for [file-path]" → needs args, "to analyze current code" → no args
- Standard tools: Git commands → Bash(git :*), file operations → Read/Edit/Write

**Default assumptions** (use unless contradicted):
- Git operations → `Bash(git :*)`
- Analysis tasks → No tool restrictions
- File modifications → `Read, Edit, Write`
- Complex multi-step → Add verification and testing sections
</step_2_ask_questions_if_needed>

<step_2b_ask_scope>
**ALWAYS ask about scope** unless explicitly specified in the request:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Scope"
- question: "Where should this command be available?"
- options:
  - "Global (all projects)" - description: "Saved to ~/.claude/commands/ - available everywhere"
  - "Project only" - description: "Saved to .claude/commands/ - shared with team via git"

**Detection rules**:
- If request says "global command" → Skip, use global scope
- If request says "project command" or "team command" → Skip, use project scope
- Otherwise → ALWAYS ask

**Important**: This determines the save location:
- Global: `~/.claude/commands/command-name.md`
- Project: `.claude/commands/command-name.md` (in current working directory)
</step_2b_ask_scope>

<step_3_choose_format>
**Ask for format preference**:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Format"
- question: "What format do you prefer for this slash command?"
- options:
  - "XML (recommended)" - description: "Claude-native format with clear structure, best for complex commands"
  - "Markdown" - description: "Familiar markdown headings, good for simple commands and documentation"

**Default to XML** if user selects "recommended" or for complex commands.

See [references/prompt-examples.md](references/prompt-examples.md) for format examples.
</step_3_choose_format>

<step_4_create_frontmatter>
**Create YAML frontmatter** based on gathered information:

```yaml
---
name: command-name
description: Clear description of what it does
argument-hint: [input] # Only if arguments needed
allowed-tools: [...] # Only if tool restrictions needed
---
```

**Frontmatter rules**:
- `description`: Always required, clear and concise
- `argument-hint`: Include if command takes user input
- `allowed-tools`: Include if restricting tools for security
- `model`: Include only if need specific model (haiku for speed, opus for complexity)
</step_4_create_frontmatter>

<step_5_create_body>
**Create command body** in chosen format (XML or Markdown):

<xml_body>
**Always include:**
- `<objective>` - What and why
- `<process>` - How to do it (numbered steps)
- `<success_criteria>` - Definition of done

**Include when relevant:**
- `<context>` - Dynamic state (! `commands`) or file references (@ files)
- `<verification>` - Checks to perform if creating artifacts
- `<testing>` - Test commands if tests are part of workflow
- `<output>` - Files created/modified

**Reference**: Apply prompt engineering best practices from create-prompt skill:
- [clarity-principles.md](../../create-prompt/references/clarity-principles.md) - Being clear and direct
- [xml-structure.md](../../create-prompt/references/xml-structure.md) - XML tag usage
- [anthropic-best-practices.md](../../create-prompt/references/anthropic-best-practices.md) - Claude-specific techniques
</xml_body>

<markdown_body>
**Always include:**
- `## Objective` - What and why
- `## Process` or `## Workflow` - How to do it (numbered list)
- `## Success Criteria` - Definition of done

**Include when relevant:**
- `## Context` - Dynamic state or file references
- `## Verification` - Checks to perform if creating artifacts
- `## Testing` - Test commands if tests are part of workflow
- `## Output` - Files created/modified
</markdown_body>
</step_5_create_body>

<step_6_integrate_arguments>
**Integrate $ARGUMENTS** if command takes input:

- If user input needed: Add `argument-hint` and use `$ARGUMENTS` in body
- If self-contained: Omit `argument-hint` and `$ARGUMENTS`
- For structured input: Use positional args `$1`, `$2`, `$3`

**Examples**: See [references/arguments.md](references/arguments.md)
</step_6_integrate_arguments>

<step_7_apply_intelligence>
**Apply appropriate complexity level**:

- **Simple commands**: Keep concise (objective + process + success criteria)
- **Complex commands**: Add context, verification, testing as needed
- **Don't over-engineer**: Simple tasks stay simple
- **Don't under-specify**: Complex tasks get full structure

**Pattern matching**: Choose pattern from [references/prompt-examples.md](references/prompt-examples.md):
- Pattern 1: Numbered workflow (git ops, CI, EPCT)
- Pattern 2: Reference/docs (CLI wrappers)
- Pattern 3: Section-based analysis (research, investigation)
</step_7_apply_intelligence>

<step_8_save_file>
**Save the command file** based on chosen scope:

**Global scope** (user selected "Global (all projects)"):
- Path: `~/.claude/commands/command-name.md`
- Available across all projects
- Personal commands, not shared with team

**Project scope** (user selected "Project only"):
- Path: `.claude/commands/command-name.md` (in current working directory)
- Shared with team via version control
- Project-specific commands

**Verification**:
- File created at correct location based on scope
- YAML frontmatter valid
- Body follows chosen format consistently
- All required sections present

**After saving**:
- Confirm location to user
- Remind them to commit if project scope
- Provide usage example: `/command-name [args]`
</step_8_save_file>

</generation_protocol>

<success_criteria>
A well-structured slash command meets these criteria:

**YAML Frontmatter**:
- `description` field is clear and concise
- `argument-hint` present if command accepts arguments
- `allowed-tools` specified if tool restrictions needed

**XML Structure**:
- All three required tags present: `<objective>`, `<process>`, `<success_criteria>`
- Conditional tags used appropriately based on complexity
- No raw markdown headings in body
- All XML tags properly closed

**Arguments Handling**:
- `$ARGUMENTS` used when command operates on user-specified data
- Positional arguments (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) used when structured input needed
- No `$ARGUMENTS` reference for self-contained commands

**Functionality**:
- Command expands correctly when invoked
- Dynamic context loads properly (bash commands, file references)
- Tool restrictions prevent unauthorized operations
- Command accomplishes intended purpose reliably

**Quality**:
- Clear, actionable instructions in `<process>` tag
- Measurable completion criteria in `<success_criteria>`
- Appropriate level of detail (not over-engineered for simple tasks)
- Examples provided when beneficial
</success_criteria>
