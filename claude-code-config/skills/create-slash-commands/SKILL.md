description: Expert guidance for creating Claude Code slash commands. Use when working with slash commands, creating custom commands, understanding command structure, or learning YAML configuration.
---

<objective>
Create effective slash commands for Claude Code that enable users to trigger reusable prompts with `/command-name` syntax. Slash commands expand as prompts in the current conversation, allowing teams to standardize workflows and operations.

Commands can be **global** (available everywhere in `~/.claude/commands/`) or **project-specific** (shared with team in `.claude/commands/`). This skill teaches you to structure commands with proper formatting (XML or Markdown), YAML frontmatter, dynamic context loading, and intelligent argument handling.

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**: This skill enforces a mandatory research phase where you MUST:
1. Read all reference documentation
2. Examine existing slash commands for patterns
3. Understand syntax and best practices
4. Only then create the command

This prevents poorly-structured commands and ensures consistency with established patterns.
</objective>

<quick_start>

<workflow>
1. Create `.claude/commands/` directory (project) or use `~/.claude/commands/` (personal)
2. Create `command-name.md` file
3. Add YAML frontmatter (at minimum: `description`)
4. Write command prompt
5. Test with `/command-name [args]`
</workflow>

<example>
**File**: `.claude/commands/optimize.md`

```markdown
---
description: Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations
---

Analyze the performance of this code and suggest three specific optimizations:
```

**Usage**: `/optimize`

Claude receives the expanded prompt and analyzes the code in context.
</example>
</quick_start>

<xml_structure>
Slash commands can use either XML tags OR Markdown headings in the body (after YAML frontmatter).

**Format choice depends on**:
- User preference (ask if not specified)
- Command complexity (XML better for complex, Markdown fine for simple)
- Existing project patterns (match what's already in use)

See [references/prompt-examples.md](references/prompt-examples.md) for real examples of both formats in production.

<required_tags>

**`<objective>`** - What the command does and why it matters

```markdown
<objective>
What needs to happen and why this matters.
Context about who uses this and what it accomplishes.
</objective>
```

**`<process>` or `<steps>`** - How to execute the command

```markdown
<process>
Sequential steps to accomplish the objective:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Final step
</process>
```

**`<success_criteria>`** - How to know the command succeeded

```markdown
<success_criteria>
Clear, measurable criteria for successful completion.
</success_criteria>
```

</required_tags>

<conditional_tags>

**`<context>`** - When loading dynamic state or files

```markdown
<context>
Current state: ! `git status`
Relevant files: @ package.json
</context>
```

(Note: Remove the space after @ in actual usage)

**`<verification>`** - When producing artifacts that need checking

```markdown
<verification>
Before completing, verify:
- Specific test or check to perform
- How to confirm it works
</verification>
```

**`<testing>`** - When running tests is part of the workflow

```markdown
<testing>
Run tests: ! `npm test`
Check linting: ! `npm run lint`
</testing>
```

**`<output>`** - When creating/modifying specific files

```markdown
<output>
Files created/modified:
- `./path/to/file.ext` - Description
</output>
```

</conditional_tags>

<structure_example>

```markdown
---
name: example-command
description: Does something useful
argument-hint: [input]
---

<objective>
Process #$ARGUMENTS to accomplish [goal].

This helps [who] achieve [outcome].
</objective>

<context>
Current state: ! `relevant command`
Files: @ relevant/files
</context>

<process>
1. Parse #$ARGUMENTS
2. Execute operation
3. Verify results
</process>

<success_criteria>

- Operation completed without errors
- Output matches expected format
  </success_criteria>
```

</structure_example>

<intelligence_rules>

**Simple commands** (single operation, no artifacts):

- Required: `<objective>`, `<process>`, `<success_criteria>`
- Example: `/check-todos`, `/first-principles`

**Complex commands** (multi-step, produces artifacts):

- Required: `<objective>`, `<process>`, `<success_criteria>`
- Add: `<context>` (if loading state), `<verification>` (if creating files), `<output>` (what gets created)
- Example: `/commit`, `/create-prompt`, `/run-prompt`

**Commands with dynamic arguments**:

- Use `#$ARGUMENTS` in `<objective>` or `<process>` tags
- Include `argument-hint` in frontmatter
- Make it clear what the arguments are for

**Commands that produce files**:

- Always include `<output>` tag specifying what gets created
- Always include `<verification>` tag with checks to perform

**Commands that run tests/builds**:

- Include `<testing>` tag with specific commands
- Include pass/fail criteria in `<success_criteria>`
  </intelligence_rules>
  </xml_structure>

<arguments_intelligence>
The skill should intelligently determine whether a slash command needs arguments.

<commands_that_need_arguments>

**User provides specific input:**

- `/fix-issue [issue-number]` - Needs issue number
- `/review-pr [pr-number]` - Needs PR number
- `/optimize [file-path]` - Needs file to optimize
- `/commit [type]` - Needs commit type (optional)

**Pattern:** Task operates on user-specified data

Include `argument-hint: [description]` in frontmatter and reference `#$ARGUMENTS` in the body.
</commands_that_need_arguments>

<commands_without_arguments>

**Self-contained procedures:**

- `/check-todos` - Operates on known file (TO-DOS.md)
- `/first-principles` - Operates on current conversation
- `/whats-next` - Analyzes current context

**Pattern:** Task operates on implicit context (current conversation, known files, project state)

Omit `argument-hint` and don't reference `#$ARGUMENTS`.
</commands_without_arguments>

<incorporating_arguments>

**In `<objective>` tag:**

```markdown
<objective>
Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following project conventions.

This ensures bugs are resolved systematically with proper testing.
</objective>
```

**In `<process>` tag:**

```markdown
<process>
1. Understand issue #$ARGUMENTS from issue tracker
2. Locate relevant code
3. Implement fix
4. Add tests
</process>
```

**In `<context>` tag:**

```markdown
<context>
Issue details: @ issues/#$ARGUMENTS.md
Related files: ! `grep -r "TODO.*#$ARGUMENTS" src/`
</context>
```

(Note: Remove the space after the exclamation mark in actual usage)
</incorporating_arguments>

<positional_arguments>

For structured input, use `$1`, `$2`, `$3`:

```markdown
---
argument-hint: <pr-number> <priority> <assignee>
---

<objective>
Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.
</objective>
```

**Usage:** `/review-pr 456 high alice`
</positional_arguments>
</arguments_intelligence>

<file_structure>

**Project commands**: `.claude/commands/` (in project root)

- Shared with team via version control
- Project-specific workflows
- Shows `(project)` in `/help` list
- Committed to git for team use

**Global commands**: `~/.claude/commands/` (user home directory)

- Available across all your projects
- Personal productivity commands
- Shows `(user)` in `/help` list
- Not shared with team

**File naming**: `command-name.md` → invoked as `/command-name`

**Choosing between global and project**:

- Use **global** for: Personal workflows, general utilities, commands you use everywhere
- Use **project** for: Team workflows, project-specific operations, shared conventions
  </file_structure>

<yaml_frontmatter>

<field name="description">
**Required** - Describes what the command does

```yaml
description: Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations
```

Shown in the `/help` command list.
</field>

<field name="allowed-tools">
**Optional** - Restricts which tools Claude can use

```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
```

**Formats**:

- Array: `allowed-tools: [Read, Edit, Write]`
- Single tool: `allowed-tools: SequentialThinking`
- Bash restrictions: `allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*)`

If omitted: All tools available
</field>
</yaml_frontmatter>

<arguments>
<all_arguments_string>

**Command file**: `.claude/commands/fix-issue.md`

```markdown
---
description: Fix issue following coding standards
---

Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards
```

**Usage**: `/fix-issue 123 high-priority`

**Claude receives**: "Fix issue #123 high-priority following our coding standards"
</all_arguments_string>

<positional_arguments_syntax>

**Command file**: `.claude/commands/review-pr.md`

```markdown
---
description: Review PR with priority and assignee
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3
```

**Usage**: `/review-pr 456 high alice`

**Claude receives**: "Review PR #456 with priority high and assign to alice"

See [references/arguments.md](references/arguments.md) for advanced patterns.
</positional_arguments_syntax>
</arguments>

<dynamic_context>

Execute bash commands before the prompt using the exclamation mark prefix directly before backticks (no space between).

**Note:** Examples below show a space after the exclamation mark to prevent execution during skill loading. In actual slash commands, remove the space.

Example:

```markdown
---
description: Create a git commit
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
---

## Context

- Current git status: ! `git status`
- Current git diff: ! `git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: ! `git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: ! `git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

The bash commands execute and their output is included in the expanded prompt.
</dynamic_context>

<file_references>

Use `@` prefix to reference specific files:

```markdown
---
description: Review implementation
---

Review the implementation in @ src/utils/helpers.js
```

(Note: Remove the space after @ in actual usage)

Claude can access the referenced file's contents.
</file_references>

<best_practices>

**1. Always use XML structure**

```yaml
# All slash commands should have XML-structured bodies
```

After frontmatter, use XML tags:

- `<objective>` - What and why (always)
- `<process>` - How to do it (always)
- `<success_criteria>` - Definition of done (always)
- Additional tags as needed (see xml_structure section)

**2. Clear descriptions**

```yaml
# Good
description: Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations

# Bad
description: Optimize stuff
```

**3. Use dynamic context for state-dependent tasks**

```markdown
Current git status: ! `git status`
Files changed: ! `git diff --name-only`
```

**4. Restrict tools when appropriate**

```yaml
# For git commands - prevent running arbitrary bash
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)

# For analysis - thinking only
allowed-tools: SequentialThinking
```

**5. Use #$ARGUMENTS for flexibility**

```markdown
Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS
```

**6. Reference relevant files**

```markdown
Review @ package.json for dependencies
Analyze @ src/database/\* for schema
```

(Note: Remove the space after @ in actual usage)
</best_practices>

<common_patterns>

**Simple analysis command**:

```markdown
---
description: Review this code for security vulnerabilities
---

<objective>
Review code for security vulnerabilities and suggest fixes.
</objective>

<process>
1. Scan code for common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
2. Identify specific issues with line numbers
3. Suggest remediation for each issue
</process>

<success_criteria>

- All major vulnerability types checked
- Specific issues identified with locations
- Actionable fixes provided
  </success_criteria>
```

**Git workflow with context**:

```markdown
---
description: Create a git commit
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
---

<objective>
Create a git commit for current changes following repository conventions.
</objective>

<context>
- Current status: ! `git status`
- Changes: ! `git diff HEAD`
- Recent commits: ! `git log --oneline -5`
</context>

<process>
1. Review staged and unstaged changes
2. Stage relevant files
3. Write commit message following recent commit style
4. Create commit
</process>

<success_criteria>

- All relevant changes staged
- Commit message follows repository conventions
- Commit created successfully
  </success_criteria>
```

**Parameterized command**:

```markdown
---
description: Fix issue following coding standards
argument-hint: [issue-number]
---

<objective>
Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following project coding standards.

This ensures bugs are resolved systematically with proper testing.
</objective>

<process>
1. Understand the issue described in ticket #$ARGUMENTS
2. Locate the relevant code in codebase
3. Implement a solution that addresses root cause
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Verify fix resolves the issue
</process>

<success_criteria>

- Issue fully understood and addressed
- Solution follows coding standards
- Tests added and passing
- No regressions introduced
  </success_criteria>
```

**File-specific command**:

```markdown
---
description: Optimize code performance
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

<objective>
Analyze performance of @ #$ARGUMENTS and suggest specific optimizations.

This helps improve application performance through targeted improvements.
</objective>

<process>
1. Review code in @ #$ARGUMENTS for performance issues
2. Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
3. Suggest three specific optimizations with rationale
4. Estimate performance impact of each
</process>

<success_criteria>

- Performance issues clearly identified
- Three concrete optimizations suggested
- Implementation guidance provided
- Performance impact estimated
  </success_criteria>
```

**Usage**: `/optimize src/utils/helpers.js`

<generation_protocol>

<step_0_mandatory_research>
**CRITICAL: Complete this research phase BEFORE proceeding to any other steps.**

You MUST read and understand these materials before creating any slash command:

**1. Read ALL reference files in order:**

Use the Read tool to read these files:
- `references/prompt-examples.md` - Real-world patterns and examples
- `references/patterns.md` - Verified command patterns
- `references/arguments.md` - Argument handling examples
- `references/tool-restrictions.md` - Tool restriction patterns

**2. Examine existing slash commands:**

Use Bash to find and Read existing commands:
```bash
find ~/.claude/commands -name "*.md" -type f | head -10
```

Then Read 2-3 relevant existing commands to understand:
- How they structure their YAML frontmatter
- What format they use (XML vs Markdown)
- How they handle arguments (#$ARGUMENTS vs positional)
- What tool restrictions they apply
- How they structure their workflow sections

**3. Identify the right pattern:**

Based on the user's request, match it to one of these patterns from prompt-examples.md:
- **Pattern 1**: Numbered workflow (git ops, CI, EPCT) - for multi-step processes
- **Pattern 2**: Reference/docs (CLI wrappers) - for command documentation
- **Pattern 3**: Section-based analysis (research, investigation) - for analysis tasks
- **Subagent patterns**: For commands that launch Task tool agents
- **Hybrid patterns**: Combining multiple approaches

**4. Check for similar existing commands:**

Before creating a new command, check if a similar command already exists:
```bash
grep -l "description.*<similar-concept>" ~/.claude/commands/*.md
```

If a similar command exists, read it to:
- Avoid duplication
- Learn from its structure
- Understand how to differentiate the new command

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**

Before proceeding to step 1, confirm you have:
- ✅ Read all 4 reference files
- ✅ Examined at least 2 existing slash commands
- ✅ Identified which pattern to use
- ✅ Checked for similar existing commands
- ✅ Understand the correct syntax (#$ARGUMENTS, tool restrictions, etc.)

**DO NOT PROCEED** until all items are checked. This research phase is non-negotiable and prevents creating poorly structured commands.

</step_0_mandatory_research>

<step_1_analyze_request>
**Analyze the user's request** to understand what they want:

- What is the command's purpose?
- Does it need user input (#$ARGUMENTS)?
- Does it produce files or artifacts?
- Does it require verification or testing?
- Is it simple (single-step) or complex (multi-step)?
- What pattern does it match? (see [references/prompt-examples.md](references/prompt-examples.md))

**Intelligence rule**: Only proceed to questions if critical information is missing. If the request is clear, skip directly to format choice.
</step_1_analyze_request>

<step_2_ask_questions_if_needed>
**INTELLIGENCE RULE**: Only ask questions if critical information is truly missing.

If the request is clear, skip directly to scope and format questions. Most requests like "create a command to X" contain enough information to proceed.

**Ask clarifying questions** ONLY if essential information is missing:

Use AskUserQuestion to gather ONLY what's needed:

1. **Command purpose** (if completely unclear):
   - header: "Purpose"
   - question: "What should this command do?"
   - Let user provide via "Other" option

2. **Arguments** (if truly ambiguous - rare):
   - header: "Arguments"
   - question: "Does this command need user input?"
   - options: "Yes - takes arguments", "No - uses context only"

**SKIP questions for**:

- Clear purposes: "create a command to commit and push" → obvious purpose
- Obvious complexity: "simple command to..." vs "command that monitors and fixes..."
- Clear arguments: "for [file-path]" → needs args, "to analyze current code" → no args
- Standard tools: Git commands → Bash(git :\*), file operations → Read/Edit/Write

**Default assumptions** (use unless contradicted):

- Git operations → `Bash(git :*)`
- Analysis tasks → No tool restrictions
- File modifications → `Read, Edit, Write`
- Complex multi-step → Add verification and testing sections
  </step_2_ask_questions_if_needed>

<step_2b_ask_scope>
**ALWAYS ask about scope** unless explicitly specified in the request:

Use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Scope"
- question: "Where should this command be available?"
- options:
  - "Global (all projects)" - description: "Saved to ~/.claude/commands/ - available everywhere"
  - "Project only" - description: "Saved to .claude/commands/ - shared with team via git"

**Detection rules**:

- If request says "global command" → Skip, use global scope
- If request says "project command" or "team command" → Skip, use project scope
- Otherwise → ALWAYS ask

**Important**: This determines the save location:

- Global: `~/.claude/commands/command-name.md`
- Project: `.claude/commands/command-name.md` (in current working directory)
  </step_2b_ask_scope>

<step_3_choose_format>
**Determine format based on existing patterns:**

Before asking the user, check what format existing commands in the target directory use:
- If creating global command: Check `~/.claude/commands/*.md`
- If creating project command: Check `.claude/commands/*.md`

Read 2-3 existing commands to see if they use XML or Markdown format.

**Then ask for format preference**:

Use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Format"
- question: "What format do you prefer for this slash command?"
- options:
  - First option based on what you found: If most commands use Markdown, make "Markdown (matches existing)" the first option
  - Second option: The alternative format
  - Include note about what existing commands use

**Recommendation**:
- Match existing commands format for consistency
- XML for complex multi-step commands
- Markdown for simple straightforward commands

See [references/prompt-examples.md](references/prompt-examples.md) for format examples.
</step_3_choose_format>

<step_4_create_frontmatter>
**Create YAML frontmatter** based on gathered information:

```yaml
---
name: command-name
description: Clear description of what it does
argument-hint: [input] # Only if arguments needed
allowed-tools: [...] # Only if tool restrictions needed
---
```

**Frontmatter rules**:

- `description`: Always required, clear and concise
- `argument-hint`: Include if command takes user input
- `allowed-tools`: Include if restricting tools for security
- `model`: Include only if need specific model (haiku for speed, opus for complexity)
  </step_4_create_frontmatter>

<step_5_create_body>
**Create command body** in chosen format (XML or Markdown):

<xml_body>
**Always include:**

- `<objective>` - What and why
- `<process>` - How to do it (numbered steps)
- `<success_criteria>` - Definition of done

**Include when relevant:**

- `<context>` - Dynamic state (! `commands`) or file references (@ files)
- `<verification>` - Checks to perform if creating artifacts
- `<testing>` - Test commands if tests are part of workflow
- `<output>` - Files created/modified

**Reference**: Apply prompt engineering best practices from create-prompt skill:

- [clarity-principles.md](../../create-prompt/references/clarity-principles.md) - Being clear and direct
- [xml-structure.md](../../create-prompt/references/xml-structure.md) - XML tag usage
- [anthropic-best-practices.md](../../create-prompt/references/anthropic-best-practices.md) - Claude-specific techniques
  </xml_body>

<markdown_body>
**Always include:**

- `## Objective` - What and why
- `## Process` or `## Workflow` - How to do it (numbered list)
- `## Success Criteria` - Definition of done

**Include when relevant:**

- `## Context` - Dynamic state or file references
- `## Verification` - Checks to perform if creating artifacts
- `## Testing` - Test commands if tests are part of workflow
- `## Output` - Files created/modified
  </markdown_body>
  </step_5_create_body>

<step_6_integrate_arguments>
**Integrate #$ARGUMENTS** if command takes input:

- If user input needed: Add `argument-hint` and use `#$ARGUMENTS` in body
- If self-contained: Omit `argument-hint` and `#$ARGUMENTS`
- For structured input: Use positional args `$1`, `$2`, `$3`

**Examples**: See [references/arguments.md](references/arguments.md)
</step_6_integrate_arguments>

<step_7_apply_intelligence>
**Apply appropriate complexity level**:

- **Simple commands**: Keep concise (objective + process + success criteria)
- **Complex commands**: Add context, verification, testing as needed
- **Don't over-engineer**: Simple tasks stay simple
- **Don't under-specify**: Complex tasks get full structure

**Pattern matching**: Choose pattern from [references/prompt-examples.md](references/prompt-examples.md):

- Pattern 1: Numbered workflow (git ops, CI, EPCT)
- Pattern 2: Reference/docs (CLI wrappers)
- Pattern 3: Section-based analysis (research, investigation)
  </step_7_apply_intelligence>

<step_8_save_file>
**Save the command file** based on chosen scope:

**Global scope** (user selected "Global (all projects)"):

- Path: `~/.claude/commands/command-name.md`
- Available across all projects
- Personal commands, not shared with team

**Project scope** (user selected "Project only"):

- Path: `.claude/commands/command-name.md` (in current working directory)
- Shared with team via version control
- Project-specific commands

**Verification**:

- File created at correct location based on scope
- YAML frontmatter valid
- Body follows chosen format consistently
- All required sections present

**After saving**:

- Confirm location to user
- Remind them to commit if project scope
- Provide usage example: `/command-name [args]`
  </step_8_save_file>

</generation_protocol>

<success_criteria>
A well-structured slash command meets these criteria:

**YAML Frontmatter**:

- `description` field is clear and concise
- `argument-hint` present if command accepts arguments
- `allowed-tools` specified if tool restrictions needed

**XML Structure**:

- All three required tags present: `<objective>`, `<process>`, `<success_criteria>`
- Conditional tags used appropriately based on complexity
- No raw markdown headings in body
- All XML tags properly closed

**Arguments Handling**:

- `#$ARGUMENTS` used when command operates on user-specified data
- Positional arguments (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) used when structured input needed
- No `#$ARGUMENTS` reference for self-contained commands

**Functionality**:

- Command expands correctly when invoked
- Dynamic context loads properly (bash commands, file references)
- Tool restrictions prevent unauthorized operations
- Command accomplishes intended purpose reliably

**Quality**:

- Clear, actionable instructions in `<process>` tag or `## Workflow` section
- Measurable completion criteria in `<success_criteria>` tag or `## Success Criteria` section
- Appropriate level of detail (not over-engineered for simple tasks)
- Examples provided when beneficial
  </success_criteria>

<common_mistakes>

## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid

These are common mistakes that result from skipping the mandatory research phase:

### ❌ MISTAKE 1: Skipping the Research Phase

**Wrong**:
```
User asks to create /quick-search command
→ Immediately ask scope/format questions
→ Create command without reading references or existing commands
→ Use wrong syntax, wrong format, miss best practices
```

**Correct**:
```
User asks to create /quick-search command
→ Read all 4 reference files first
→ Find and examine existing commands (especially /search if it exists)
→ Understand patterns and syntax
→ Then ask questions and create command
```

### ❌ MISTAKE 2: Using Wrong Argument Syntax

**Wrong**:
```markdown
---
description: Quick search
---
Answer the question: #args
```

**Correct**:
```markdown
---
description: Quick search
argument-hint: <question>
---
User: #$ARGUMENTS
```

The correct syntax is `#$ARGUMENTS` (not `#args`). This is documented in references/arguments.md.

### ❌ MISTAKE 3: Not Checking for Similar Commands

**Wrong**:
- Create `/quick-search` without checking if `/search` already exists
- Result: Duplicate functionality, confusion

**Correct**:
- Check existing commands first: `find ~/.claude/commands -name "*.md"`
- If similar command exists, read it to understand how to differentiate
- Consider if the new command is really needed

### ❌ MISTAKE 4: Wrong Format Choice

**Wrong**:
- User asks for command
- Randomly choose XML or Markdown without checking existing commands
- Result: Inconsistent codebase

**Correct**:
- Check what format existing commands use
- Match that format for consistency
- Only deviate if user explicitly requests different format

### ❌ MISTAKE 5: Missing Tool Restrictions

**Wrong**:
```yaml
---
description: Quick search with Haiku model
model: haiku
---
```

**Correct**:
```yaml
---
description: Quick search with Haiku model
model: haiku
allowed-tools: [Grep, Glob, Read]
---
```

For speed-optimized commands, restrict tools to prevent using slow agents like Task.

### ❌ MISTAKE 6: Not Matching Existing Patterns

**Wrong**:
- Create unique structure that doesn't match any existing pattern
- Result: Hard to maintain, unfamiliar to users

**Correct**:
- Read prompt-examples.md to see verified patterns
- Match your command to Pattern 1, 2, 3, or hybrid
- Follow the established structure

### ❌ MISTAKE 7: Not Including "User: #$ARGUMENTS" at the End

**Wrong**:
```markdown
---
description: Search command
argument-hint: <question>
---

You are a search specialist.

## Workflow
1. Search for the answer
2. Provide results
```

**Correct**:
```markdown
---
description: Search command
argument-hint: <question>
---

You are a search specialist.

## Workflow
1. Search for the answer
2. Provide results

---

User: #$ARGUMENTS
```

Many commands end with `User: #$ARGUMENTS` to properly pass the user's input to the command.

### ❌ MISTAKE 8: Over-Engineering Simple Commands

**Wrong**:
```markdown
<objective>Create comprehensive search system</objective>
<context>Load all git state</context>
<verification>Run extensive checks</verification>
<testing>Test all edge cases</testing>
```

For a simple search command, this is too much.

**Correct**:
```markdown
You are a rapid search specialist.

## Workflow
1. Search
2. Answer

User: #$ARGUMENTS
```

Match complexity to the task.

## How to Avoid These Mistakes

**Follow the Step 0 checklist religiously**:
1. ✅ Read all 4 reference files
2. ✅ Examine 2-3 existing commands
3. ✅ Identify the pattern to use
4. ✅ Check for similar commands
5. ✅ Understand correct syntax

**If you skip Step 0, you WILL make these mistakes.**
