# Phase 1: Expansive Exploration

**Role: CURIOUS EXPLORER** - Generate maximum insight breadth without filtering

---

<available_state>
From SKILL.md entry point:

- `{topic}` - The research topic
- `{economy_mode}` - If true, use direct tool calls instead of subagents
- `{fast_mode}` - If true, skip Phase 2 and condense Phase 3
- `{save_file}` - If true, save session to file
- `{session_path}` - Path to session file (if saving)
</available_state>

<mandatory_rules>
## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- 🔍 EXPLORE without judgment - quantity over quality in this phase
- 🌐 LAUNCH parallel agents for maximum coverage
- 💡 CAPTURE every interesting thread, even tangential ones
- 🎯 EXPAND scope - what adjacent areas might matter?
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN: Filtering, critiquing, or discarding ideas in this phase
</mandatory_rules>

---

<execution_sequence>

<parse_topic>
**1. Parse and Expand Topic Scope**

Analyze the topic to identify:
- **Core question**: What exactly are we researching?
- **Adjacent areas**: What related topics might inform this?
- **Key terms**: What should we search for?
- **Stakeholders**: Who cares about this topic and why?

**Scope Expansion:**
"For `{topic}`, I'm also considering:
- [Related area 1] - because it might affect...
- [Related area 2] - to understand alternatives...
- [Related area 3] - to see historical context..."
</parse_topic>

<parallel_agents>
**2. Execute Research**

<economy_mode_research>
**If `{economy_mode}` = true:** Use direct tool calls in main thread

**Web Search** (use WebSearch tool directly)
- Search: `{topic} best practices 2024 2025`
- Search: `{topic} comparison alternatives`
- Search: `{topic} real-world examples case studies`

**Documentation** (use mcp__context7__resolve-library-id + mcp__context7__query-docs if technical)
- Find relevant library documentation for tools mentioned in topic

**Codebase** (use Grep/Glob directly if applicable)
- `Grep` for patterns related to topic in codebase
- `Glob` for relevant file types
</economy_mode_research>

<standard_mode_research>
**If `{economy_mode}` = false:** Launch parallel subagents

**CRITICAL: Launch ALL agents in a SINGLE message for parallel execution.**

**Agent 1: Web Search** (`websearch`)
```
Research the current state of: {topic}

Find:
1. Current best practices and popular approaches
2. Recent developments and trends (2024-2025)
3. Key players, thought leaders, and their perspectives
4. Common use cases and applications
5. Any recent controversies or debates

Focus on diverse, authoritative sources.
```

**Agent 2: Documentation Research** (`explore-docs`) - if technical topic
```
Find documentation and technical guidance for: {topic}

Search for:
1. Official documentation from relevant tools/frameworks
2. Best practices guides
3. Code examples and patterns
4. Configuration recommendations
5. Known limitations or gotchas

Focus on practical implementation guidance.
```

**Agent 3: Codebase Exploration** (`explore-codebase`) - if applicable
```
Search the codebase for patterns related to: {topic}

Find:
1. Existing implementations of similar functionality
2. Patterns and conventions already in use
3. Related utilities or helpers
4. Test patterns for similar features
5. Any prior attempts or related code

Return file paths with line numbers.
```
</standard_mode_research>
</parallel_agents>

<interactive_check>
**3. Quick Check** (skip if `{fast_mode}`)

If NOT in fast mode, briefly ask:

"Initial research done on **{topic}**. Any specific angle you want me to focus on? (or 'continue')"
</interactive_check>

<synthesize>
**4. Synthesize Broad Findings**

Combine all agent findings into comprehensive overview:

```
## Phase 1 Discoveries: {topic}

**Current Landscape:**
- [Finding 1 with source]
- [Finding 2 with source]
- [Finding 3 with source]

**Key Players & Perspectives:**
- [Player/Expert 1]: [Their view]
- [Player/Expert 2]: [Their view]

**Popular Approaches:**
1. [Approach 1] - used by [who], pros/cons
2. [Approach 2] - used by [who], pros/cons
3. [Approach 3] - used by [who], pros/cons

**Interesting Threads:**
- [Tangential but relevant finding]
- [Unexpected connection]
- [Emerging trend]

**Initial Impressions:**
At first glance, it seems like [initial take]. But this needs to be challenged.

**Questions Raised:**
- [Question that emerged from research]
- [Uncertainty that needs investigation]
```

Store in `{phase_1_discoveries}`
</synthesize>

<save_progress>
**5. Save Progress** (if `{save_file}` is true)

Append to `{session_path}`:
```markdown
# Brainstorm Session: {topic}
**Date:** {current_date}

## Phase 1: Expansive Exploration

[Phase 1 discoveries content]

```
</save_progress>

</execution_sequence>

<success_metrics>

- Multiple parallel agents launched for breadth
- Scope expanded beyond obvious interpretations
- Diverse sources and perspectives gathered
- Tangential but relevant threads captured
- Initial questions and uncertainties noted
- No premature filtering or conclusions
</success_metrics>

<failure_modes>

- Launching agents sequentially instead of parallel
- Only searching for confirming evidence
- Filtering out "irrelevant" findings too early
- Drawing conclusions before Phase 4
- Missing adjacent areas that could inform the topic
</failure_modes>

<next_step_directive>
**CRITICAL:** After presenting Phase 1 discoveries:

**If `{fast_mode}` = true:**
"**Phase 1 complete.** Skipping challenge phase (fast mode).

Loading `step-03-synthesize.md`..."

→ Load `steps/step-03-synthesize.md` directly

**If `{fast_mode}` = false:**
"**Phase 1 complete.** We've cast a wide net and gathered diverse perspectives.

**NEXT: Phase 2 - Critical Challenge**

Now I become the DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. Every finding above will be questioned and stress-tested.

Loading `step-02-challenge.md`..."

→ Load `steps/step-02-challenge.md`
